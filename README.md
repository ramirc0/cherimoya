[[CATv1]](https://huggingface.co/programmable-genomics/CATv1)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cherimoya is under active development and may introduce breaking changes between versions. Pin the version you train with if you need to reload checkpoints later.

Cherimoya is a compact deep learning model for predicting genomic modalities measured by high-throughput sequencing experiments, such as transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, transcription initiation, and many others, directly from DNA sequence. Cherimoya builds upon the ChromBPNet model through a backbone made up of new Cheri Block units, more sophisticated optimization, and custom GPU kernels to accelerate training and inference. In addition to the model, this repository provides an end-to-end CLI for training and using these models, including a pipeline command that takes BAM files through peak calling, training, attribution, and motif discovery in a single command. The default 9-layer model is **~610K parameters** and runs a full forward pass on a batch of 64 sequences of 2,114 bp in **about 2.3 ms in bf16 (3.3 ms in fp32) on an H200**, while delivering state-of-the-art performance.

> [!NOTE]

### Design highlights

The backbone is built from **Cheri Blocks** — each a depthwise dilated convolution followed by per-example layer normalization and a channel-mixing MLP, allowing spatial and channel information to be aggregated cheaply and at separate stages of each block. Training uses a tuned three-way optimizer split: **Muon** for projection weights, **SGD** for the Kendall uncertainty weights, **AdamW** for everything else. The profile and counts losses are combined via **Kendall-Gal uncertainty weighting** with two learnable weights per signal group — one for the profile term and one for the counts term — replacing the usual fixed loss weight with ones the model balances on its own. An **exponential moving average** of the parameters is maintained during training and used at evaluation, smoothing both the validation curve and the final predictions. Several **stability-first** choices keep deep stacks well-behaved: a small fixed residual scale at initialization, no biases in the blocks, weight decay applied only to the Muon-routed projection weights (`muon_wd = 0.03`, against `adam_wd = 0.0` for everything else), and a small warmup before cosine decay. Details of the architecture and the training recipe were arrived at via agent-driven autoresearch exploration of the design space. See [the architecture docs](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html) for more information.

### Installation

```bash
pip install cherimoya          # or: uv pip install cherimoya
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmschrei/cherimoya.git
cd cherimoya && pip install -e .
```

Or pull the prebuilt Docker image, published to the GitHub Container Registry on every push to `main`:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/jmschrei/cherimoya:latest
```

Each push also tags the image with the version in `pyproject.toml`, so a version tag follows `main` while that version is current rather than pinning a release.

GPU acceleration requires Triton and a CUDA-capable device; a pure-PyTorch CPU fallback is available for everything except the inference megakernel. See [the installation guide](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for Triton compatibility notes.

### What you can do with Cherimoya

- Train a sequence-to-function model on [TF ChIP-seq](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/chipseq_tf.html), [ATAC-seq](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/atacseq.html), [DNase-seq](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/dnaseq.html), or any signal that can be expressed as a stranded or unstranded coverage track. Multi-task models that share a backbone across several modalities — for example ATAC co-trained with several stranded TFs — are also supported; see [the multi-task guide](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi_task.html). Training runs on PyTorch Lightning, on one GPU or, with the `devices` setting, [several GPUs with DDP](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#training-on-several-devices).
- Compute per-base attribution scores via [DeepLIFT/SHAP or *in silico* saturation mutagenesis](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/attribution.html).
- Call seqlets and discover *de novo* motifs with [TF-MoDISco](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/attribution.html#tf-modisco-motif-discovery).
- Annotate seqlets against a known motif database via [tomtom-lite](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/attribution.html#tomtom-lite-annotation).
- [Marginalize](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/variant_effect.html#motif-marginalization-cli) the contribution of inserted motifs in counterfactual sequence designs.
- [Score variants](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/variant_effect.html) by predicting their effects on the underlying profile and counts.
- Repeat a training run from its seed — training is seeded by default (`random_state = 0`), which fixes both the model's initialization and the peak/negative sampler's draw order (a pure function of `(seed, epoch, index)`, so `num_workers > 1` is purely a speed optimization that produces the same batch sequence as `num_workers = 1`). Seeded runs are bitwise identical on CPU; on CUDA they share an initialization and an example order but diverge as training compounds the last-bit differences from the fused kernel's atomic reductions. Changing the number of GPUs keeps the examples each step sees.
- Stream remote BAM, BED, and FASTA inputs directly without downloading them first.

### The Cheri Block

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmschrei/cherimoya/main/imgs/cheri-block.png">

Each block performs a 3-tap dilated depthwise convolution, a per-example layer normalization, a linear expansion to `expansion × n_filters` channels, a GELU non-linearity, a contraction back to `n_filters` channels, and a residual connection scaled by a small fixed constant (`residual_scale`, default `0.15`). The convolution and normalization are fused into a custom Triton kernel; under `torch.no_grad()` the entire block (including the MLP) collapses into a second fused megakernel for inference. The default 9-layer model uses dilations `1, 2, 4, ..., 256`, giving a receptive field of 1117 bp and a 2114 → 1000 bp input/output by default. See [the architecture docs](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html) for receptive field math, kernel internals, and the rationale for each design choice.

### Performance

Per-call latency (ms) on an NVIDIA H200 for a single Cheri Block at `N=512, L=1024, C=128, dilation=4`, in `.eval()` mode. The inference megakernel is automatically dispatched under `torch.no_grad()`; calling `.eval()` first lets it reuse a precomputed bf16 weight cast across calls instead of recomputing every call, which matters more at small batches (see the benchmarks page).

| dtype | training-fwd | megakernel |
|---|---|---|
| fp32 | 1.337 | **0.498** |
| bf16 | 0.707 | **0.347** |
| fp16 | 0.706 | **0.347** |

On the default model at fp32, the three paths agree on the profile logits to within 2.5e-4 max-abs against a logit scale of 0.73, so a trained checkpoint gives the same predictions to that bound through any of them — they are not bitwise identical. A pure-PyTorch CPU fallback is also available for development and one-off evaluation on a laptop. See [the benchmarks page](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks.html) for small-batch breakdowns and full methodology.

### Multi-GPU training

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmschrei/cherimoya/main/imgs/multi-gpu-speedup.png" width=60%>

Training runs on PyTorch Lightning, so setting `devices` in the fit config (or passing `devices=` to `cherimoya.training.fit`) trains on several GPUs with DDP. `batch_size` stays the global batch, split evenly across the GPUs, so every step sees the same examples as on one GPU. The figure shows the training speedup at the default global batch of 64 on H200 GPUs, for one ATAC-seq experiment (2,322 steps per epoch). Larger models scale further, because each GPU's share of the batch is more work: the 512-filter model reaches 3.1–3.3× on 4 GPUs and the 12-layer model with a 9,282 bp input window 4.0–4.6× on 8, while the default model gains at most 2.4×. Giving each GPU 64 examples instead scales 7.0–7.7× on 8 GPUs, at the cost of a larger global batch that changes the training. See [training on several devices](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#training-on-several-devices) for how to set it up.

### End-to-end CLI pipeline

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmschrei/cherimoya/main/imgs/pipeline.png" width=70%>

The CLI strings the full pipeline (peak calling, signal extraction, training, attribution, seqlet calling, motif discovery) into a single reproducible run. It is configured with [Hydra](https://hydra.cc): every key has a typed default, so you only give the keys that differ, as `key=value` overrides or in a YAML file.

Provide a reference genome, one or more signal files, optional controls, a BED of positive loci, and a motif database. Set `loci` or `negatives` to `null` to have the pipeline call peaks or sample GC-matched negatives. For stranded ChIP-seq with input controls (full recipe [here](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/chipseq_tf.html)):

```bash
cherimoya pipeline name=my_experiment sequences=hg38.fa \
    'loci=[peaks.narrowPeak]' negatives=null \
    'signals=[chipseq_rep1.bam,chipseq_rep2.bam]' \
    'controls=[input_rep1.bam,input_rep2.bam]' \
    motifs=JASPAR_2024.meme
```

`signals` is the ChIP signal (IP reads) and `controls` is the unenriched-DNA input control (optional). Quote the lists so the shell leaves the brackets alone.

For unstranded paired-end ATAC-seq with the standard +4/−4 fragment shift (full recipe [here](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/atacseq.html)):

```bash
cherimoya pipeline name=atac_experiment sequences=hg38.fa \
    'loci=[peaks.narrowPeak]' negatives=null \
    'signals=[fragments.bam]' motifs=JASPAR_2024.meme \
    preprocessing.pos_shift=4 preprocessing.neg_shift=-4 \
    preprocessing.unstranded=true preprocessing.paired_end=true
```

Any input path can be remote (S3, HTTPS, etc.); the pipeline streams reads through `bam2bw` directly.

To keep the config in a file, add `--cfg job > pipeline.yaml` to either command. That prints every key with its default and runs nothing. Edit the file to change model width, training/validation chromosomes, seqlet p-value threshold, MoDISco settings or anything else, then run:

```bash
cherimoya pipeline -p pipeline.yaml
```

This calls peaks with MACS3 (unless `loci` gave peaks, as above), samples GC-matched negatives, trains a Cherimoya model, computes attributions with DeepLIFT/SHAP, calls seqlets, annotates them with tomtom-lite, and runs TF-MoDISco. The outputs land in the working directory: a `.torch` model checkpoint and training log, per-track bigWigs, a DeepLIFT/SHAP attribution array (`.npz`), a seqlet table with tomtom-lite annotations, and a TF-MoDISco results H5. Each step saves its config as `<name>.<command>.yaml`, so a stage can be rerun alone, e.g. `cherimoya fit -p my_experiment.fit.yaml`. Add `-m` to sweep a key and train one model per value: `cherimoya fit -p my_experiment.fit.yaml -m random_state=0,1,2`. A JSON config written by an earlier version still loads with `-p` if every key is in the new schema, but a pipeline JSON needs converting first. See [the CLI reference](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html) for the conversion and for every command and key.

### Python API and saving/loading

For programmatic use, the public API is `Cherimoya` (the model), `CheriBlock` (the building block), `EMA` (the parameter exponential-moving-average wrapper used during training), and four output wrappers — `ControlWrapper`, `ProfileWrapper`, `LogCountWrapper`, and `ExpectedCountsWrapper` — that expose a single tensor from the model's `(profile, log-count)` output for attribution and design tools. Training is `cherimoya.training.fit`, which builds a PyTorch Lightning `Trainer` around the model. See the [Python API tutorial](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/python_api.html) for an end-to-end training walkthrough:

```python
from cherimoya import Cherimoya

model = Cherimoya(n_filters=128, n_layers=9).cuda()
y_profile, y_counts = model(X)              # X: (N, 4, L) one-hot DNA
```

Models are saved as a config + state_dict bundle, not a pickled module. This format is robust to source-layout changes and safe to load with `weights_only=True`:

```python
model.save("my_model.torch")
model = Cherimoya.load("my_model.torch")              # CPU by default
model = Cherimoya.load("my_model.torch", device="cuda")
```

Older checkpoints saved with `torch.save(model, ...)` are not compatible with `Cherimoya.load` and must be retrained. The CLI subcommands and `cherimoya.training.fit(...)` use this format internally. See [the save/load guide](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/save_load.html) for full semantics (including that the saved weights are the EMA snapshot) and [the training API reference](https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/training.html) for the full `fit()` signature.

### Claude Code skill

Cherimoya ships an agent skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) that teaches the assistant to drive the CLI pipeline and Python API on your behalf — working out which inputs you have, choosing assay-appropriate settings, calling the right subcommands, and interpreting the outputs. It uses progressive disclosure: a short router plus topic-specific reference files (training pipeline, input files, assay defaults, interpreting outputs, troubleshooting, CLI reference, Python usage, tangermeme analysis, and a concepts primer) that load only when relevant. The skill is built to ask a clarifying question when an input is ambiguous rather than guess, and to explain in plain language which defaults it applied and why — so it stays useful even if you're new to sequence modeling.

Install it with the bundled subcommand:

```bash
cherimoya install-skill
```

This copies the skill into `~/.claude/skills/cherimoya`. Options:

- `-d, --directory DIR` — install into a different skills directory (default `~/.claude/skills`).
- `--symlink` — symlink the packaged skill instead of copying it, so in-place edits to the installed package are reflected without reinstalling.
- `-f, --force` — overwrite an existing installation at the destination.

Restart Claude Code (or reload skills) to pick it up, then just describe what you want — for example, *"I have a ChIP-seq BAM and a genome FASTA here, train a Cherimoya model on them"* — and the skill guides the run, asking about anything it needs.
