# Analyzing a Cherimoya model with tangermeme

Post-training analysis — attributions via saturation mutagenesis (ISM, the
method Cherimoya uses), marginalization, variant-effect scoring, and sequence
design — lives in **tangermeme**, not Cherimoya. (DeepLIFT/SHAP via
`deep_lift_shap` is an alternative on a wrapped model.) Cherimoya's only job is
to expose the right single tensor from its `(profile, log-count)` output.

**If a `tangermeme` skill is available, invoke it for the actual analysis.**
This file covers only the Cherimoya-specific step — choosing and applying the
output wrapper — and does not duplicate tangermeme's API. Read the tangermeme
skill/docs for the analysis call; don't guess its signature.

## The wrappers (from `cherimoya`)

tangermeme's tools expect a model returning a **single tensor**, but Cherimoya
returns `(profile, log-count)`. Pick the wrapper for what you want to attribute
or optimize:

| Wrapper | Returns | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `ProfileWrapper` | scalar per example from profile logits (weighted softmax) | profile **shape** |
| `LogCountWrapper` | the log-count prediction | **total signal** (counts) at a locus |
| `ExpectedCountsWrapper` | expected reads per base pair | per-position expected counts |
| `ControlWrapper` | raw `(profile, log-count)`, synthesizing a zero control if needed | the **inner** wrapper for control-trained models |

**`LogCountWrapper` (counts) is the recommended default; use `ProfileWrapper`
when you care about profile shape.** `ControlWrapper` is the inner layer the
profile/count wrappers sit on: for a control-trained model whose analysis tool
passes only a sequence, it supplies a zero control of the right
shape/dtype/device automatically. For a model with no controls it's a
pass-through, so wrapping is always safe.

## Pattern

```python
from cherimoya import Cherimoya
from cherimoya import ControlWrapper
from cherimoya import LogCountWrapper

model = Cherimoya.load("my_run.torch", device="cuda")
model = model.eval()

# Attribute the counts (usual default); ControlWrapper handles a
# control-trained model transparently. Swap in ProfileWrapper for shape.
wrapper = LogCountWrapper(ControlWrapper(model))

# Hand `wrapper` to tangermeme (saturation_mutagenesis, deep_lift_shap,
# variant effect, ledidi design, ...).
```

## What lives where

- **Cherimoya** — the model and the four wrappers above. Use these, not
  bpnet-lite's.
- **tangermeme** — `predict`, `saturation_mutagenesis`, `deep_lift_shap`,
  `variant_effect`, `ersatz` (motif insertion), `seqlet.recursive_seqlets`,
  `io.extract_loci`, MEME/bigWig/VCF loaders, plotting. Don't reimplement.
- **ledidi** — gradient-based sequence design against a wrapped model, when the
  user wants to *design* rather than *analyze*.

The CLI already wires these for the standard flow (`attribute`, `seqlets`,
`marginalize` in `cli-training-pipeline.md`). Reach for tangermeme directly only
for something the pipeline doesn't do — a custom attribution target, variant
scoring, or bespoke design objective.
