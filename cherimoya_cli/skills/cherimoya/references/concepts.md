# Concepts — the vocabulary in one place

A plain-language primer for a user new to sequence modeling. Load this when a
term below is blocking understanding; for depth, the docs glossary at
<https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io> is authoritative.

## What the model does

Cherimoya is a **sequence-to-function** model: given a stretch of DNA (one-hot
encoded, `(batch, 4, length)`), it predicts a genomic assay's coverage over that
stretch. Training teaches it which sequence patterns drive the measured signal.

## Profile vs. counts (the two output heads)

Every forward returns `(profile, log-count)` — two complementary views of the
same locus:
- **Profile** — the *shape* of the signal at base-pair resolution across the
  output window (default 1000 bp): where within the region the reads pile up.
- **Counts** — the *total* signal in the window (one number per group), trained
  against `log(count + 1)`. This is the headline "how much signal is here"
  prediction; `count_pearson` on held-out data is the usual quality metric.

A model can be good at one and not the other — hence separate metrics.

## Peaks, negatives, controls

- **Peaks (`loci`)** — genomic regions of interest, the **positive** examples
  (where the assay shows enrichment). Supplied as a BED, or called by MACS3 from
  the signal.
- **Negatives** — **background** regions the model also trains on so it learns
  what *absence* of signal looks like. GC-matched to the peaks; `negative_ratio`
  (default 0.25) sets how many per peak per epoch.
- **Controls** — an unenriched track (ChIP input / IgG) that captures
  background/bias. A model trained *with* controls must be used *with* them
  thereafter, or the count head sees garbage.

## Strandedness

Some assays distinguish the `+` and `-` DNA strands (a `(+, -)` pair of tracks);
others don't (one unstranded track). This is a per-assay property, not
inferable from a filename — see `assay-defaults.md`. Getting it wrong is silent;
see the grouping footgun in `input-files.md`.

## Attribution, seqlets, motifs

The "what did the model learn" chain, in order:
- **Attribution** — per-base importance scores: which bases the model relied on
  for its prediction. Cherimoya computes these by **saturation mutagenesis
  (ISM)** — mutating each base and measuring the change in prediction.
- **Seqlets** — short, contiguous high-importance stretches pulled out of the
  attributions (lengths ~4–25 bp): candidate functional elements.
- **Motifs** — recurring sequence patterns (e.g. a transcription-factor binding
  site). **TF-MoDISco** clusters seqlets into *de novo* motifs; a supplied MEME
  motif database lets those discovered motifs be *named* against known ones.
- **Marginalization** — a complementary check: insert a known motif into
  background sequences and measure how much the model's prediction responds — how
  much it "cares" about that motif.

## Training vocabulary

- **Held-out (validation) chromosomes** — whole chromosomes kept out of training
  (default hg38 split: chr8, chr20) so metrics measure generalization to unseen
  sequence, not memorization. Must match your genome build.
- **EMA (exponential moving average)** — a smoothed running average of the model
  weights kept during training; it validates better than the raw weights.
  Cherimoya **saves the EMA weights**, so a reloaded model reproduces the EMA
  validation numbers in the log, not the mid-epoch training loss (see
  `interpreting-outputs.md`).
- **Reverse-complement augmentation** — training also shows the model each
  sequence's reverse complement (on by default); for stranded data this swaps the
  `+`/`-` tracks, which is why stranded pairs must be grouped correctly.
- **Early stopping** — training halts after a set number of epochs (default 5)
  with no improvement in validation count Pearson, keeping the best checkpoint.

For every default value, see `cli.md` or `cherimoya_cli/defaults.py`.
