# Reading what the pipeline produced

Maps every output file to a plain-language answer to "did it work?", "is the
model good?", and "what did it learn?" `{name}` is the `-n` value from step 1.

## "Did it work / is it any good?" — the model and its metrics

### `{name}.test.performance.tsv` and `{name}.validation.performance.tsv` — the scorecard
The same table for two sets of held-out chromosomes. **Quote the test file**
(`test_chroms`, default chr1, chr3, chr6): those chromosomes took no part in
training or in choosing the checkpoint. The validation file (`validation_chroms`,
default chr8, chr20) scores the chromosomes that picked the best epoch, so it
runs slightly optimistic. There is no test file when `test_chroms` is `null`.

One row per signal group. Seven columns computed on the **peaks**:
`profile_mnll`, `profile_jsd`, `profile_pearson`, `profile_spearman`,
`count_pearson`, `count_spearman`, `count_mse`. Then five that also use the
negatives on those chromosomes, `nan` when there are none: `all_count_pearson`,
`all_count_spearman`, `all_count_mse` (over peaks and negatives together), and
`auroc` / `auprc` (how well the predicted counts tell peaks from negatives;
AUPRC depends on the peak:negative ratio, so compare it only between runs with
the same negatives).

Headline number: **`count_pearson`** — how well predicted per-peak total signal
correlates with truth on held-out chromosomes.
- Good models on a solid dataset land well above 0.5, often 0.7–0.9+.
- Near 0 means it didn't learn — see "stuck Pearson" in
  `references/troubleshooting.md` (common causes: validation chromosomes
  with no peaks, dropped controls, an uninformative signal).

`profile_pearson` / `profile_jsd` describe how well the profile **shape**
(base-pair resolution) was learned, separate from total counts.

### `{name}.log` — per-epoch training curve
One row per epoch (train/validation metrics). Validation metrics are on peaks,
except the four columns before `Saved?` (count Pearson and MSE over
peaks+negatives, AUROC, AUPRC), which are empty without negatives. `Saved?`, the
last column, marks each epoch that improved the best validation count Pearson;
`{name}.torch` holds the last of them. Shows whether validation count
Pearson climbed and which epoch the kept checkpoint came from. **Compare final
results against the EMA validation numbers here, not the mid-epoch training
loss** (see the checkpoint note below).

### `{name}.detailed.log`
`.log` plus per-group `ProfilePearson_g{i}` / `CountPearson_g{i}` /
`AUROC_g{i}` / `AUPRC_g{i}` columns —
only relevant for multi-group (multi-task) models.

### `{name}.torch` vs `{name}.final.torch` — which checkpoint to use
Both are **EMA-applied** snapshots (an exponential moving average of the
weights, which validates better than the raw training weights):
- **`{name}.torch`** — the **best validation count Pearson** epoch. Downstream
  steps load this; use it for analysis. Load with `Cherimoya.load`.
- **`{name}.final.torch`** — the EMA snapshot at the **final** epoch; interesting
  only if you want the end-of-training state. Because these are EMA weights, a
  reloaded model reproduces the *EMA* validation row in the log, not any
  mid-epoch loss — expected, not a bug.

## Intermediate data files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `{name}_peaks.narrowPeak` | Peaks MACS3 called (when you didn't supply peaks). |
| `{name}.negatives.bed` | GC-matched background regions (when you didn't supply negatives). |
| `{name}.+.bw` / `{name}.-.bw` / `{name}.bw` | bigWig coverage `bam2bw` made (stranded pair / unstranded). |
| `{name}.control.*.bw` | Same, for controls. |

## "What did the model learn?" — interpretation outputs

### Attributions — `{name}.attributions.*`
Per-base importance from DeepLIFT/SHAP (or saturation mutagenesis, with
`algorithm`), over the central 400 bp of each locus, as three aligned files:
- `{name}.attributions.ohe.npz` — one-hot input sequences (that 400 bp span).
- `{name}.attributions.attr.npz` — hypothetical importance scores.
- `{name}.attributions.idxs.npy` — boolean mask back to the original loci list
  (which loci survived N-filtering).

Don't eyeball these as files; load and plot them (see
`references/using-tangermeme.md`) or let the seqlet/MoDISco steps
consume them.

### Seqlets — `{name}.seqlets.bed`
Short, high-importance stretches pulled from the attributions, in genome
coordinates — the candidate functional elements the model found. Every seqlet
falls inside the slice `attribute` scored (400bp centred on each locus by
default), so a seqlet outside its peak means the file was produced before the
coordinate fix and the run needs `cherimoya seqlets` re-run over the same
attribution `.npz` files.

### Annotated seqlets — `{name}.seqlets_annotated.bed` + `{name}.motif_seqlet_count.tsv`
Only with a motif database. tomtom-lite labels each seqlet with its closest
known motif; the `.tsv` tallies matches per motif — a quick "which TFs did the
model rely on" summary.

### TF-MoDISco — `{name}_modisco_results.h5` + `{name}_modisco/`
*De novo* motifs aggregated across all seqlets. The `.h5` holds the patterns;
`{name}_modisco/` is a browsable **HTML report** (open `report.html`) — usually
the most satisfying thing to show a user, with names when a motif database was
supplied.

### Marginalization — `{name}_marginalize/`
Only with a motif database. Inserts each known motif into background sequences
and measures the model's predicted response — an HTML report with PNG figures of how
much the model "cares" about each motif.

## Per-step configs

`{name}.{negatives,fit,evaluate,attribute,seqlets,marginalize}.yaml` record the
exact config each step ran with. They are the record of what happened, and
each is a `-p` file for rerunning that step
(`cherimoya <step> -p {name}.<step>.yaml`). Hydra also saves the composed
config and the command-line overrides of every run in `.hydra/<command>/`.
That `config.yaml` is written before the run, so a drawn `random_state` isn't
in it.
