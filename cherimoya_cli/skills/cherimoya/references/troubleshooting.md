# Troubleshooting a Cherimoya run

Common failures, the symptom each produces, and what to change. Match the
symptom here first. Authoritative version:
<https://cherimoya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html>.

## Prerequisites (check first)

- **GPU.** Training and high-throughput inference want a CUDA GPU. A pure-PyTorch
  CPU fallback exists for everything except the inference megakernel, so the
  package runs on CPU, but **training on CPU is impractical at any realistic
  scale** — warn the user before starting. CPU is fine for interactive use.
- **Triton** is a hard dependency and installs from PyPI automatically on
  standard Linux + CUDA. Unusual toolchains may need a manual Triton install.

## "CUDA out of memory" at the start of training

Cheapest fixes first:
1. Lower `fit.batch_size` (64 → 32 → 16 → 8), e.g. `fit.batch_size=32` on the
   pipeline or `batch_size=32` on `cherimoya fit`.
2. Set `fit.dtype=bfloat16` (bf16 autocast).
3. Shrink the model: `fit.n_filters` (128 → 96).
4. With more than one GPU free, set `fit.devices`: `batch_size` is the global
   batch, so each GPU holds `batch_size / devices` examples.

The default (batch 64, 2114 bp window, 9-layer/128-filter model) fits
comfortably on a 16 GB GPU. Reducing batch size is cheapest; don't change model
complexity without user input.

## Errors when training on several GPUs (`devices` > 1)

- `batch_size (64) must be divisible by the number of devices (3)` — the
  global batch is split evenly; pick a `batch_size` the GPU count divides.
- `` `Trainer(strategy='ddp')` is not compatible with an interactive
  environment`` — multi-GPU training was started in a Jupyter notebook. Run a
  script or `cherimoya fit` from a terminal instead.
- `` You set `devices=4` in Lightning, but the number of tasks per node
  configured in SLURM `--ntasks-per-node=1` does not match`` — inside a SLURM
  job, Lightning expects `srun` to start one process per GPU: request
  `--ntasks-per-node` equal to `devices` and launch `srun cherimoya fit -p ...`.
- The run lands on GPUs someone else is using — `devices: N` takes the first N
  visible GPUs; set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the free ones.

## "CUDA out of memory" in the attribute step

Under DeepLIFT/SHAP (the default `algorithm`), `attribute.batch_size`
counts sequence-reference pairs, each run forward and backward. On the default
model at 2114 bp, 16 pairs peaked at 4.0 GB, 32 at 7.8 GB, 64 at 15.5 GB and 512
at 124 GB, with about the same wall time at each. Lower
`batch_size` (64 → 32 → 16); with a fixed `random_state` the attributions are
the same at any batch size, up to float rounding.

## "Convergence deltas too high" during attribution

DeepLIFT/SHAP scores for an example and a reference should sum to the difference
in their predictions; the warning fires when a pair misses by more than
`warning_threshold` (default 0.001, absolute, in the units of the attributed
output). The known cause is Python code calling tangermeme's `deep_lift_shap`
without `additional_nonlinear_ops=attribution_ops()` (from
`cherimoya.deep_lift_shap`). `cherimoya attribute` always registers them.

## "The first iteration is very slow, then it speeds up"

Not a bug — **Triton autotune** sweeping kernel configs on the first call, then
caching the winner for the process. The first inference call autotunes
separately. Nothing to fix.

## "Training loss is NaN"

By likelihood:
1. **Mismatched strand counts** — stranded data passed flat (or unstranded data
   as a pair) gives `y` the wrong shape. Compare the number of signal files with
   the grouping the user intends. Confirm a stranded `(+, -)` pair
   is nested (`[["plus.bw","minus.bw"]]`), not flat (see
   `references/input-files.md`).
2. **bf16 overflow in the count head** — with `fit.dtype=bfloat16` and very
   large per-locus counts. Rerun in `float32` to confirm; if that fixes it, scale
   the signal down with `preprocessing.scale_factor`.

## "Stranded predictions come almost entirely from one strand"

A stranded `(+, -)` model (TF ChIP, PRO-cap, etc.) whose reconstructed
`ExpectedCountsWrapper` profile has nearly all its signal on one strand,
even though the observed data has comparable coverage on both (offset by
~100-300 bp). Fixed in v0.2.0: the profile loss now
normalizes each signal group's channels **jointly** (one multinomial over
both strands + length) instead of per-strand, so the strand balance is
trained. Models trained with an older release have an uncalibrated
strand offset baked into their weights — **retrain** with a current
release to fix. Unstranded ATAC/DNase models are unaffected (the change
is bit-identical for single-channel groups). See the CHANGELOG entry
"Loss (breaking for stranded/multi-channel models)".

## "Validation Pearson is stuck near zero"

1. **Validation chromosomes contain no peaks.** Check `Validation Set Size` at
   startup — if ~0, your `validation_chroms` don't intersect your peaks. Common
   when peaks are subset to one chromosome, or when the genome isn't hg38 and the
   default chr8/chr20 split is wrong.
2. **Controls were silently dropped.** A control-trained model evaluated without
   controls collapses. The evaluate step must list the same `controls` as fit.
3. **Train and validation signals differ** (e.g. different replicates) — a much
   harder generalization problem than across-chromosome.
4. **The signal is genuinely uninformative.** Sanity-check on a known-good target
   (e.g. CTCF in K562 from ENCODE); if that converges, the issue is upstream of
   Cherimoya.

## "Is my dataset even big enough?"

- **Peaks:** <2,000 → expect underfitting; 2,000–10,000 → workable, reduce
  `n_filters` to 64-96; 10,000+ → defaults fine; 50,000+ → larger models
  (`n_filters=192`/`256`) worth trying.
- **Depth:** <~50 reads/peak → profile metrics noise-dominated (pool replicates
  before peak calling); hundreds → normal; thousands (ATAC/DNase) →
  signal-limited, not data-limited.

## "MACS3 hangs or returns no peaks"

- A large BAM can take ~10 min in MACS3 — normal.
- Empty peak file on a small BAM → `callpeaks_q` too strict; try 0.1 or 0.5.
- Wrong auto-detected format → set `preprocessing.callpeaks_format`
  explicitly (e.g. `BAMPE` for paired-end).

## "bam2bw couldn't open a remote URL"

Streaming needs the remote store to support range requests. Public ENCODE HTTPS
BAMs, S3-presigned URLs, and standard GCS objects work. Credentialed buckets
need `AWS_*` / `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set first.

## "torch.compile / CUDA-graph error at inference time"

A `torch._dynamo`/`torch._inductor` traceback from inside `Cherimoya.forward`, or
"accessing tensor output of CUDAGraphs that has been overwritten". The forward is
wrapped in `torch.compile(mode='max-autotune')` by default. **If you don't
immediately recognize the error, load with `compile=False`** — numerically
identical, at the cost of the compile speedup:

```python
model = Cherimoya.load("checkpoint.torch", device="cuda", compile=False)
# or keep autotuned kernels, skip only the CUDA graph:
model = Cherimoya.load("checkpoint.torch", device="cuda",
                       compile_mode='max-autotune-no-cudagraphs')
```

From the CLI, rerun the step with the setting as an override:

```bash
cherimoya evaluate -p my_run.test.evaluate.yaml compile=false
cherimoya evaluate -p my_run.test.evaluate.yaml compile_mode=max-autotune-no-cudagraphs
```

For the evaluations that `fit` runs after training, set `compile=false` on
`fit` or at the top of a pipeline, or rerun one as above from
`{name}.validation.evaluate.yaml` or `{name}.test.evaluate.yaml`.

For fastest inference, call `model.eval()` before predicting so the megakernel
reuses its bf16 weight cast.

## "Key 'x' not in 'FitConfig'" or "Must provide a value for: ..."

The config was rejected before any work started. The first is a typo or a key
that command doesn't have (check `cherimoya <command> --help`); in a pipeline,
step keys are dotted (`fit.n_filters`, not `n_filters`). Hydra's message also
suggests `To append to your config use +n_filter=...`. **Don't follow it:** the
`+` form adds the misspelled key without error, and nothing reads it. Fix the
spelling instead. The second lists every
required key with no value. In a pipeline, set `loci` or `negatives` to `null`
to have the pipeline produce them.

A JSON config from an earlier version fails the first way when it sets a key
the new schema lacks, such as a pipeline's `fit_parameters`.
`references/cli-training-pipeline.md` lists the conversion steps.

## "FileNotFoundError: The following inputs are missing"

Every local input path is checked before running, relative to the directory
the command started in. Fix the path, or, if the pipeline is supposed to make
the file, set that key to `null`.

## "Cherimoya.load rejects a checkpoint" (`KeyError: 'config'` or `UnpicklingError: Weights only load failed`)

The checkpoint was saved with the legacy `torch.save(model, ...)` path from
before v0.1.0. It's not loadable by the current config-plus-state-dict loader;
retrain with the current release. See `references/using-in-python.md` for
the save/load format.

## "The loaded model predicts differently than training reported"

Not a mismatch. The saved checkpoint holds the **EMA-applied** weights, which
produced the best validation numbers. Compare against the **EMA validation** row
in `{name}.log`, not the mid-epoch training loss. See the checkpoint note in
`references/interpreting-outputs.md`.
