class EMA:
	"""Exponential moving average of a model's parameters.

	Maintains a shadow copy of every floating-point parameter that is
	updated as ``shadow = decay * shadow + (1 - decay) * parameter`` after
	each training step. The shadow weights are typically used at
	evaluation time, where they tend to produce smoother and more stable
	predictions than the raw running weights.

	Typical usage during training:

	1. Create an EMA wrapper after the model is constructed.
	2. Call :meth:`update` after every optimizer step.
	3. Call :meth:`apply_shadow` before evaluation to swap the shadow
	   weights into the model.
	4. Call :meth:`restore` after evaluation to put the training weights
	   back.

	Parameters
	----------
	model: torch.nn.Module
		The model whose parameters will be tracked.

	decay: float, optional
		The decay factor of the moving average. Larger values place more
		weight on the running shadow and less on each new update. Default

def _group_depths(y, signal_groups, reduce=None, weights=None):
	"""Batch-mean observed counts for each signal group.

	The profile MNLL is a sum of per-read log-likelihoods, so it scales with
	read depth; dividing each group's term by its own depth makes the
	weighted term depth-invariant. The channel axis of ``y`` is ordered by
	group, so a group's depth is a sum over its own channels only.

	Summing over every group at once instead would rescale all groups by the
	same number and leave their weights relative to each other untouched,
	which is not a normalization across groups at all.


	Parameters
	----------
	y: torch.tensor, shape=(batch_size, n_channels, length)
		The observed counts.

	signal_groups: list of int
		Channels belonging to each group, in order.

	reduce: callable or None, optional
		Applied to the per-group means before the floor. Data-parallel
		training passes one that averages them across devices, so that the
		depths are those of the whole global batch. Default is None.

	weights: torch.tensor or None, shape=(batch_size, n_groups), optional
		Per-example, per-group weights, the ones the losses are weighted
		with (see :func:`cherimoya.losses._mixture_loss`). Each group's
		depth is then ``(counts * weights).mean()``, so an example left out
		of a group's loss is left out of its depth. Default is None.


	Returns
	-------
	depths: torch.tensor, shape=(n_groups,)
		Batch-mean counts per group, floored at 1 so the division is safe on
		a batch where a group has no reads.

class Cherimoya(torch.nn.Module):
	"""The Cherimoya sequence-to-function model.

	Parameters
	----------
	n_filters: int, optional
		Width of the convolutional backbone (the channel dimension).
		Default is 128.

	n_layers: int, optional
		Number of stacked Cheri Blocks. Block ``i`` uses dilation
		``2**i``. Default is 9.

	signal_groups: list of int, optional
		The number of channels in each signal group. A signal group is
		one biological modality whose channels share an orientation: a
		single-channel (unstranded) track is a group of size 1, a
		stranded ``(+, -)`` pair is a group of size 2. The profile head
		emits one channel per signal channel (total
		``sum(signal_groups)`` outputs); the count head emits one
		prediction per *group* (total ``len(signal_groups)``). Default
		is ``[1]`` — a single unstranded track.

	n_control_tracks: int, optional
		Number of control input tracks (the total channel count
		summed across all control groups, if any). If 0, the model
		takes only the one-hot sequence as input. Default is 0.

	expansion: int, optional
		Channel-expansion factor for the MLP inside each Cheri Block. The
		inner projection maps ``n_filters -> expansion * n_filters`` and
		then back. Default is 2.

	residual_scale: float, optional
		Fixed scalar applied to the MLP output of each Cheri Block before
		it is added back to the residual stream. Default is 0.15.

	name: str or None, optional
		Display name used when saving model files. Defaults to
		``"cherimoya.{n_filters}.{n_layers}"``.

	trimming: int or None, optional
		Number of base pairs to trim from each side of the input when
		producing the output profile. If None, defaults to
		``46 + sum(2**i for i in range(n_layers))``.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Unused. It was the switch for the training log's stdout output,
		which moved to :func:`cherimoya.training.fit`, and is kept because
		every saved checkpoint's config passes it. Default is True.

	compile: bool, optional
		Whether to wrap the forward in ``torch.compile``. A runtime
		setting, not saved in the checkpoint. Default is True.

	compile_mode: str, optional
		The ``mode`` passed to ``torch.compile``; ignored when `compile`
		is False. Default is ``'max-autotune'``.

	random_state: int or None, optional
		Seed for the weight initialization. Every parameter in the model
		is either overwritten by one of the ``trunc_normal_`` calls
		below, zeroed, or set to one, so a given seed fully determines
		the starting weights regardless of the global RNG state. The
		seed is *not* stored in the checkpoint: it describes how a model
		was initialized, not its architecture, and a loaded model takes
		its weights from the state dict rather than from init. If None,
		the global RNG is used and the initialization is not
		reproducible. Default is None.
