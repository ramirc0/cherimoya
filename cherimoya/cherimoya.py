class EMA:
	"""Exponential moving average of a model's parameters.

	Maintains a shadow copy of every floating-point parameter that is
	updated as ``shadow = decay * shadow + (1 - decay) * parameter`` after
	each training step. The shadow weights are typically used at
	evaluation time, where they tend to produce smoother and more stable
	predictions than the raw running weights.

	Typical usage during training:

	1. Create an EMA wrapper after the model is constructed.
	2. Call :meth:`update` after every optimizer step.
	3. Call :meth:`apply_shadow` before evaluation to swap the shadow
	   weights into the model.
	4. Call :meth:`restore` after evaluation to put the training weights
	   back.

	Parameters
	----------
	model: torch.nn.Module
		The model whose parameters will be tracked.

	decay: float, optional
		The decay factor of the moving average. Larger values place more
		weight on the running shadow and less on each new update. Default

	Parameters
	----------
	n_filters: int, optional
		Width of the convolutional backbone (the channel dimension).
		Default is 96.

	n_layers: int, optional
		Number of stacked Cheri Blocks. Block ``i`` uses dilation
		``2**i``. Default is 9.

	signal_groups: list of int, optional
		The number of channels in each signal group. A signal group is
		one biological modality whose channels share an orientation: a
		single-channel (unstranded) track is a group of size 1, a
		stranded ``(+, -)`` pair is a group of size 2. The profile head
		emits one channel per signal channel (total
		``sum(signal_groups)`` outputs); the count head emits one
		prediction per *group* (total ``len(signal_groups)``). Default
		is ``[1]`` — a single unstranded track.

	n_outputs: int, optional, DEPRECATED
		Provided only as a back-compat shorthand for callers and old
		checkpoints written before ``signal_groups`` existed. When given
		without ``signal_groups``, this is interpreted as
		``signal_groups=[1] * n_outputs`` — i.e. every output channel is
		its own unstranded group. Mutually exclusive with
		``signal_groups`` (passing both raises if they disagree).
		Default is None.

	n_control_tracks: int, optional
		Number of control input tracks (the total channel count
		summed across all control groups, if any). If 0, the model
		takes only the one-hot sequence as input. Default is 0.

	expansion: int, optional
		Channel-expansion factor for the MLP inside each Cheri Block. The
		inner projection maps ``n_filters -> expansion * n_filters`` and
		then back. Default is 2.

	residual_scale: float, optional
		Fixed scalar applied to the MLP output of each Cheri Block before
		it is added back to the residual stream. Default is 0.15.

	name: str or None, optional
		Display name used when saving model files. Defaults to
		``"cherimoya.{n_filters}.{n_layers}"``.

	trimming: int or None, optional
		Number of base pairs to trim from each side of the input when
		producing the output profile. If None, defaults to
		``46 + sum(2**i for i in range(n_layers))``.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether the training-progress logger prints to stdout. Default
		is True.

		----------

			A generator that produces examples to train on. If n_control_tracks

		muon_optimizer: torch.optim.Optimizer
			A Muon optimizer to control the training of the 2D non-head/non-tail layers
			in the model. This is mostly the dense layers and depth-wise convolutions of
			the Cheri blocks.

		adam_optimizer: torch.optim.Optimizer
			An Adam/W optimizer to control the training of the other parametrers. This
			should be the head/tail layers, the bias terms, and any other parameters
			that are not 2D matrices.

		muon_scheduler: torch.optim.lr_scheduler
			The scheduler to use for the Muon optimizer. This should likely be a cosine
			decay with a warmup phase.

		adam_scheduler: torch.optim.lr_scheduler
			The scheduler to use for the Adam/W optimizer. This should likely be the
			same cosine decay with a warmup phase used for the Muon optimizer.

		X_valid: torch.tensor, shape=(n, 4, length)
			A block of sequences to validate on at the end of each epoch.

		X_ctl_valid: torch.tensor or None, shape=(n, n_control_tracks, length)
			A block of control sequences to use for making the validation set
			predictions at the end of each epoch. If n_control_tracks is None, pass in
			None. Default is None.

		y_valid: torch.tensor or None, shape=(n, n_outputs, output_length)
			A block of signals to validate against at the end of each epochs.

		max_epochs: int
			The maximum number of epochs to train for, as measured by the
			number of times that `training_data` is exhausted. Default is 50.

		batch_size: int, optional
			The number of examples to include in each batch. Default is 64.

		dtype: str or torch.dtype
			The torch.dtype to use when training. Usually, this will be torch.float32
			or torch.bfloat16. Default is torch.float32.

		device: str
			The device to use for training and inference. Typically, this will be
			'cuda' but can be anything supported by torch. Default is 'cuda'.

		early_stopping: int or None, optional
			Whether to stop training early. If None, continue training until
			max_epochs is reached. If an integer, continue training until that
