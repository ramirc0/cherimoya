"""
Training a Cherimoya model with PyTorch Lightning.

:class:`CherimoyaModule` holds one training step, the validation pass and
the checkpointing hooks, and :func:`fit` builds the `Trainer` around it.
On one device the step does what the pre-Lightning ``Cherimoya.fit`` loop
did, in the same order; on several devices the global batch is split
across them by :class:`~cherimoya.io.ShardedEpochSampler` and DDP averages
the gradients, so every step sees the examples one device would have.

	set, and the per-locus statistics are gathered so that the metrics are
	computed over the whole set, exactly as on one device.

	Saved checkpoints hold the EMA shadow in the :meth:`Cherimoya.save`
	format.

	Parameters
	----------
	model: Cherimoya
		The model to train.

	training_data: PeakNegativeSampler
		The training dataset. It must accept `(epoch, index)` pairs, which
		is how :class:`~cherimoya.io.ShardedEpochSampler` addresses it.

	X_valid: torch.tensor, shape=(n, 4, length)
		Validation sequences.

	y_valid: torch.tensor, shape=(n, sum(signal_groups), output_length)
		Validation signal.

	X_ctl_valid: torch.tensor or None, shape=(n, n_control_tracks, length)
		Validation controls, or None if the model takes none. Default is
		None.

	labels_valid: torch.tensor or None, shape=(n,)
		1 for each validation peak and 0 for each negative. The profile
		measures, the count Pearson and MSE, and the checkpoint criterion
		are computed on the peaks alone. With negatives, the last four log
		columns hold the count Pearson and MSE over peaks and negatives
		together, and the AUROC and AUPRC of the predicted log counts
		separating the two; without them, they are NaN. If None, every
		example is a peak. Default is None.

	masks_valid: torch.tensor or None, shape=(n, n_groups), optional
		Which signal groups score each validation example, as the
		training sampler's per-group masks do. Each group's measures then
		use its own examples: the peaks it scores for the profile and
		count measures and the checkpoint criterion, and those plus the
		negatives it scores for the measures that use negatives. If None,
		every group scores every example. Default is None.

	batch_size: int, optional
		The global batch size, split evenly across devices. Also the batch
		size each device validates with. Default is 64.

	num_workers: int, optional
		Data-loading workers per device. Default is 1.

	n_warmup_steps: int, optional
		Steps of linear learning-rate warmup, from 1% of each rate. Default
		is 0.

	n_decay_steps: int or None, optional
		Steps of cosine decay for the Muon and AdamW rates after warmup.
		Past it the cosine rises again. If None, the decay spans the rest
		of the run, Lightning's estimate of its steps less the warmup. The
		`lw` rate is held constant instead. Default is None.

	muon_lr, muon_wd: float, optional
		Muon learning rate and weight decay. Defaults are 0.025 and 0.03.

	adam_lr, adam_wd: float, optional
		AdamW learning rate and weight decay. Defaults are 0.001 and 0.

	lw_lr, lw_wd, lw_momentum: float, optional
		SGD learning rate, weight decay and momentum for `lw0` and `lw1`.
		Defaults are 0.001, 0 and 0.9.

	loss_weights: tuple or None, optional
		Fixed `(profile, count)` weights replacing the learned Kendall
		weights. The profile term is first divided by each group's
		batch-mean read depth, and `lw0` / `lw1` stop receiving gradient.
		If None, the Kendall weights are learned until the mean magnitude
		of `lw0`'s gradient at the end of an epoch drops below 1, and are
		held fixed after that. Default is None.

	ema_decay: float, optional
		Decay of the EMA of the weights. Default is 0.999.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to print the training log as it is written: the header when
		fitting starts, then one row per epoch, above the progress bar when
		there is one. Default is False.

	Four files are written next to ``model.name``: ``{name}.torch``, the
	EMA weights from the epoch with the highest mean validation count
	Pearson; ``{name}.final.torch``, the EMA weights at the end of
	training; ``{name}.log``, one tab-separated row per epoch of training
	and validation measures; and ``{name}.detailed.log``, the same with
	one profile Pearson, count Pearson, AUROC and AUPRC column per signal
	group. The validation measures that use negatives are NaN unless
	``labels_valid`` (see :class:`CherimoyaModule`) marks some examples as
	negatives.

	Parameters
	----------
	model: Cherimoya
		The model to train.

	training_data: PeakNegativeSampler
		The training dataset.

	X_valid, y_valid, X_ctl_valid: torch.tensor
		The validation set; see :class:`CherimoyaModule`.

	max_epochs: int, optional
		The number of passes over the training data. Default is 50.

	early_stopping: int or None, optional
		Stop after this many epochs without an improvement in the
		validation count Pearson. If None, train for `max_epochs`. Default
		is None.

	dtype: str, optional
		``'float32'``, ``'bfloat16'`` or ``'float16'``. The two half
		precisions run the forward pass under autocast, and ``'float16'``
		also scales the loss. Default is ``'float32'``.

	accelerator: str, optional
		The Lightning accelerator, e.g. ``'gpu'``, ``'cpu'`` or
		``'auto'``. Default is ``'auto'``.

	devices: int, optional
		The number of devices. More than one trains with DDP, with the
		global batch split evenly across them, and sets
		``torch._dynamo.config.optimize_ddp`` to False in the training
		process (see :meth:`CherimoyaModule.setup`). -1 uses every visible
		device. Lightning starts the other processes by re-running the
		current command, so more than one requires a script rather than a
		Jupyter notebook. Default is 1.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to print the per-epoch table of training and validation
		measures (see :class:`CherimoyaModule`) and to allow a progress bar.
		Lightning's own messages are not shown either way, only its
		warnings. Default is False.

	progress_bar: bool or None, optional
		Whether to draw Lightning's progress bar when `verbose` is set. None
		draws it only when stdout is a terminal or a Jupyter kernel, so that
		output redirected to a file holds just the table. Several runs that
		share one terminal overwrite each other's bars; pass False for them.
		Default is None.

	**kwargs
		Passed to :class:`CherimoyaModule`.

	Returns
	-------
	trainer: lightning.Trainer
		The trainer after fitting. ``trainer.lightning_module.model`` holds
		the EMA weights, and ``trainer.checkpoint_callback.best_model_score``
		the best validation count Pearson.
