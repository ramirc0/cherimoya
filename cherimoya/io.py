	empty list means "zero output channels", which would produce a
	degenerate model). Raises a ``ValueError`` with a clear message
	naming the bad value so the user can fix the JSON or kwarg.


	Parameters
	----------
	groups : sequence
		The candidate ``signal_groups`` / ``control_groups`` value to
		validate.

	label : str, optional
		The kwarg or field name to mention in the error message — lets

def normalize_signal_groups(signals):
	"""Normalize a structured ``signals``/``controls`` spec into flat files.

	Cherimoya organizes signals into *groups* so reverse-complement
	augmentation can swap channels correctly. Each group is one biological
	modality whose channels share an orientation: an unstranded track is a
	single-channel group; a stranded ``(+, -)`` pair is a two-channel group.

	Accepted inputs::

		None
			Returns ``(None, [])``.

		[str, str, ...]
			A flat list of N files. Each file is treated as its **own**
			single-channel (unstranded) group. (Note: this is a breaking
			change relative to pre-grouping cherimoya, where a flat
			two-element list was implicitly a stranded pair. Old BPNet
			callers should now wrap the pair: ``[["plus.bw", "minus.bw"]]``.)

		[entry, entry, ...]
			A list whose entries are each either a single ``str`` (a
			one-channel group, shorthand for ``[str]``) or a ``list[str]``
			(a multi-channel group). Mix freely, e.g.::

				signals = ["atac.bw", ["ctcf.+.bw", "ctcf.-.bw"]]

			declares two groups: one unstranded ATAC channel and one
			stranded CTCF pair.

	Parameters
	----------
	signals : None, list of str, or list of (str or list of str)
		The structured signals spec as described above.


	Returns
	-------
	flat_files : list of str or None
		The files in concatenation order across groups. ``None`` if
		``signals`` was ``None``. This is the form that ``extract_loci``

		list if ``signals`` was ``None``.

class PeakNegativeSampler(torch.utils.data.Dataset):

	Here, a set of peaks and negatives are separately loaded. These sets can be
	any size. From these sets, batches of given size are sampled that are a
	mixture of peaks and negatives.

	Sampling is fully deterministic given ``random_state`` and the epoch
	number. ``__getitem__(idx)`` is a pure function of ``idx`` and the
	current epoch, so ``num_workers > 1`` produces the same per-index
	data tuples as ``num_workers = 1`` — the DataLoader yields identical
	batch sequences, just faster.

	Each peak is drawn exactly once per epoch; the peak/negative
	interleaving and all augmentations are reproducible from
	``(random_state, epoch)``.

	In the documentation below, ``mj`` = max_jitter.

	Parameters
	----------
	peak_sequences: torch.tensor, shape=(n_peaks, 4, in_window+2*mj)
		A tensor of peak sequences that are one-hot encoded.

	peak_signals: torch.tensor, shape=(n_peaks, t, out_window+2*mj)
		A tensor of signals to predict, usually base-pair resolution
		integer counts.

	peak_controls: torch.tensor, shape=(n, t, out_window+2*mj) or None,
			optional
		Optional control input track for peak examples.

	negative_sequences: torch.tensor, shape=(n, 4, in_window+2*mj)
		One-hot encoded negative sequences.

	negative_signals: torch.tensor, shape=(n, t, out_window+2*mj)
		Negative sequence signals.

	negative_controls: torch.tensor or None, optional
		Optional control input track for negative examples.

	negative_ratio: float, optional
		Ratio of negatives to peaks per epoch. ``0`` means no negative
		draws. Default 0.1.

	in_window: int, optional
		The input window size. Default 2114.

	out_window: int, optional
		The output window size. Default 1000.

	max_jitter: int, optional
		Maximum jitter (in either direction) applied to peaks. Default 0.

	reverse_complement: bool, optional
		Whether to reverse complement-augment half of the data. Default
		False.

	shuffle: bool, optional
		Whether to shuffle the peak ordering each epoch. Default True.

	random_state: int or None, optional
		Base seed for the deterministic per-epoch RNG. If None, a random
		seed is captured once at construction time so that all forked
		worker processes share it.

	signal_perm: torch.LongTensor or None, optional
		The channel permutation to apply to ``peak_signals`` /
		``negative_signals`` under reverse-complement augmentation. If
		``None``, no channel permutation is applied (only the length
		dimension is flipped). This must be precomputed by the caller
		from the signal-group structure — see
		:func:`channel_permutation_from_groups`. Default is None.

	control_perm: torch.LongTensor or None, optional
		Same as ``signal_perm`` but applied to the control tracks. Default
		is None.

	This function will extract signal from all signal and control files,
	pass that into a DataGenerator, and wrap that using a PyTorch data
	loader. This is the only function that needs to be used.


	Parameters
	----------
	peaks: str or pandas.DataFrame or list/tuple of such
		A BED-formatted file containing peak coordinates. This can be either
		the string path to the BED file or a pandas DataFrame object containing
		three columns: chrom, start, and end. Alternatively, this can be a list
		of such objects whose coordinates will be interleaved.

	negatives: str or pandas.DataFrame or list/tuple of such
		A BED-formatted file containing negative coordinates. This can be either
		the string path to the BED file or a pandas DataFrame object containing
		three columns: chrom, start, and end. Alternatively, this can be a list
		of such objects whose coordinates will be interleaved.

	sequences: str or dictionary
		Either the path to a fasta file to read from or a dictionary where the
		keys are the unique set of chromosoms and the values are one-hot
		encoded sequences as numpy arrays or memory maps.

	signals: list of strs, list of (str or list of str), or list of dictionaries
		The signal-track specification. There are two accepted shapes:

		1. A flat list of strings — each element is a one-channel
		   (unstranded) group. This is the common ATAC/DNase case.

		2. A list whose entries are each either a ``str`` (a one-channel
		   group, shorthand for ``[str]``) or a ``list[str]`` (a multi-
		   channel group, e.g. a stranded ``(+, -)`` pair). Mix freely::

		       signals = ["atac.bw", ["ctcf.+.bw", "ctcf.-.bw"]]

		Each group's channels share an orientation and get swapped under
		reverse-complement augmentation; groups never bleed into one
		another. See :func:`normalize_signal_groups`.

		A list of per-chromosome dictionaries is also accepted (one
		dictionary per channel, in the same concatenation order produced
		by :func:`normalize_signal_groups`). In that case the caller
		must pass ``signal_groups`` explicitly so this function knows
		how to group the channels.

	controls: same shape as ``signals``, or None, optional
		The control-track specification, sharing the same grouping rule
		as ``signals``. If None, no control tensor is returned. Default
		is None.

	chroms: list or None, optional
		A set of chromosomes to extact loci from. Loci in other chromosomes
		in the locus file are ignored. If None, all loci are used. Default is
		None.

	in_window: int, optional
		The input window size. Default is 2114.

	out_window: int, optional
		The output window size. Default is 1000.

	max_jitter: int, optional
		The maximum amount of jitter to add, in either direction, to the
		midpoints that are passed in. Default is 500.

	negative_ratio: float, optional
		The ratio of negatives compared to peaks in each batch. A value of 1 means
		that each batch is balanced, and a value of 10 means that there would be 10
		negatives for each positive. Note that this is independent of the number of
		peaks and negatives provided. Even if the `peaks` input has 10x the number
		of coordinates as the `negatives` one, if the ratio is 1 each batch during
		training will be balanced (on average).

	reverse_complement: bool, optional
		Whether to reverse complement-augment half of the data. Default is True.

	shuffle: bool, optional
		Whether to randomly sample peaks, if True, or to proceed sequentially
		through them, if False. Negatives are always randomly sampled. Default
		is True.

	min_counts: float or None, optional
		The minimum number of counts, summed across the length of each example
		and across all tasks, needed to be kept. If None, no minimum. Default
		is None.

	max_counts: float or None, optional
		The maximum number of counts, summed across the length of each example
		and across all tasks, needed to be kept. If None, no maximum. Default
		is None.

	summits: bool, optional
		Whether to return a region centered around the summit instead of the center
		between the start and end. If True, it will add the 10th column (index 9)
		to the start to get the center of the window, and so the data must be in
		narrowPeak format.

	exclusion_lists: list or None, optional
		A list of strings of filenames to BED-formatted files containing exclusion
		lists, i.e., regions where overlapping loci should be filtered out. If None,
		no filtering is performed based on exclusion zones. Default is None.

	random_state: int or None, optional
		Base seed for the sampler's deterministic per-epoch RNG. If None,
		a seed is captured once from system entropy.

	pin_memory: bool, optional
		Whether to pin page memory to make data loading onto a GPU easier.
		Default is True.

	num_workers: int, optional
		The number of processes fetching data at a time to feed into a
		model. If 0, data is fetched from the main process (synchronous,
		can become a bottleneck because each batch blocks the GPU).
		Default is 1, which runs one async prefetch worker. Higher values
		are safe and produce the **same** sequence of batches as
		``num_workers = 1``, just faster: ``__getitem__(idx)`` is a pure
		function of ``idx`` and the current epoch, so all workers compute
		the same data for any given index.

	batch_size: int, optional
		The number of data elements per batch. Default is 192.

	verbose: bool, optional
		Whether to display a progress bar while loading. Default is False.

	signal_groups: list of int or None, optional
		The size of each group in ``signals``. When ``signals`` is given
		as a list of strings or as a structured (mixed) list this is
		derived automatically. Must be supplied explicitly only when
		``signals`` is a flat list of per-chromosome dictionaries (no
		group information can be inferred from that form). Default is
		None.

	control_groups: list of int or None, optional
		Same as ``signal_groups`` but for ``controls``. Default is None.
