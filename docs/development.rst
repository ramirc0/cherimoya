Development
===========

This page is for contributors and integrators: how the source tree
is organized, how to run the tests, and the conventions the
codebase follows. End users do not need to read this.

Two top-level packages: ``cherimoya`` is the model and data plumbing,
``cherimoya_cli`` is the command-line tool. They are independent —
``cherimoya_cli`` imports ``cherimoya``, never the reverse.


Public vs. private API
----------------------

The convention is the standard Python one: anything prefixed with an
underscore is private, and may change or be removed without notice.
Explicitly:

* **Public** symbols, re-exported from ``cherimoya.__init__``:
  :class:`~cherimoya.Cherimoya`, :class:`~cherimoya.CheriBlock`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.cherimoya.EMA`, and the four model wrappers
  :class:`~cherimoya.wrappers.ControlWrapper`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.wrappers.ProfileWrapper`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.wrappers.LogCountWrapper` and
  :class:`~cherimoya.wrappers.ExpectedCountsWrapper`.
* **Public** module-level symbols:
  :func:`~cherimoya.io.PeakGenerator`,
  :func:`~cherimoya.io.interleave_masks`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.io.PeakNegativeSampler`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.io.ShardedEpochSampler`,
  :func:`~cherimoya.training.fit`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.training.CherimoyaModule`,
  :func:`~cherimoya.cheri.fused_dilated_conv_norm`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.cheri.FusedDilatedConvNorm`,
  :class:`~cherimoya.cheri.FusedDilatedConvNormFunc`,
  :func:`~cherimoya.performance.calculate_performance_measures` and
  its component metrics, :func:`~cherimoya.deep_lift_shap.attribution_ops`,
  :func:`~cherimoya.losses._mixture_loss`
  (despite the underscore — it is the trainer's loss function and
  the API is stable).

  :func:`~cherimoya.deep_lift_shap.attribution_ops` is public because
  every DeepLIFT/SHAP call on a Cherimoya model has to pass it, so the
  documentation tells users to import it from ``cherimoya.deep_lift_shap``.
  Its name, import path, and the fact that it returns a dict suitable
  for ``additional_nonlinear_ops`` are a compatibility surface; which
  rules the dict contains may change as the model does.

  :class:`~cherimoya.cheri.FusedDilatedConvNorm` is public because
  naming the class *is* the interface: an attribution method that wants
  to treat the fused convolution specially has to identify it by type,
  so the name and import path are a compatibility surface even though
  nothing in this package calls the class from outside
  :class:`~cherimoya.CheriBlock`.
  The count head's control-track log has no counterpart class. It is a
  plain ``torch.log`` call, deliberately: its input is the summed control
  tracks, which attribution holds fixed between a sequence and its
  references, so a module there would be a hook point with nothing to
  correct.
* **Private** and may change: anything else, including the Triton
  kernels (``_fwd_*``, ``_bwd_*``, ``_fwd_inf_*``), the CPU fallback
  (``_cheri_conv_norm_cpu``), the CheriBlock weight-cast buffers
  (``_w1_eval_bf16``, ``_w2_eval_bf16``, ``_w2_eval_native``), and the
  model's checkpoint-payload helper
  (``_init_kwargs``).


Development install
-------------------

For development, install in editable mode with the ``docs`` extra:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/jmschrei/cherimoya.git
   cd cherimoya
   pip install -e .[docs]

The ``docs`` extra adds ``sphinx``, ``furo``, and
``sphinx-copybutton``, which you need to build this documentation
locally:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs
   sphinx-build -b html . _build

The build produces ``docs/_build/index.html``. Read the Docs builds
with ``docs/requirements.txt`` alone, without installing the package;
``conf.py`` mocks the heavy dependencies so autodoc can import it
anyway.


Running the tests
-----------------

The test suite lives in ``tests/`` and uses pytest.

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest tests/

Test files. ``tests/`` covers the library, ``tests/commands/`` covers
the ``cherimoya`` CLI:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 34 66

   * - File
     - Covers
   * - ``tests/test_cheri.py``
     - Cheri Block forward parity (CPU vs training Triton vs
       inference megakernel), backward parity against CPU
       autograd, weight-cache invalidation, dtype matrix.
   * - ``tests/test_cheri_autotune.py``
     - The first backward at a shape no earlier test has used, which
       is the only way the autotune path can be exercised.
   * - ``tests/test_model.py``
     - Full Cherimoya forward/backward parity, no_grad ==
       grad-enabled equivalence, and save/load round trips.
   * - ``tests/test_compile.py``
     - ``compile`` / ``compile_mode`` semantics, and that neither
       leaks into a saved checkpoint's config.
   * - ``tests/test_training.py``
     - Lightning training against a reference loop, bitwise on CPU;
       the best and final EMA checkpoints; the columns and layout of
       ``{name}.log`` and ``{name}.detailed.log``; the measures that use
       validation negatives, and that negatives leave the peak-only
       columns unchanged; early stopping; the
       guards against a training set smaller than one batch and an
       unknown ``dtype``; validation shards covering every row once.
   * - ``tests/test_io.py``
     - ``PeakGenerator`` and ``PeakNegativeSampler`` reproducibility,
       per-epoch determinism, multi-worker equivalence, and
       ``ShardedEpochSampler`` matching one rank's sequence across
       ranks.
   * - ``tests/test_ema.py``
     - EMA update/apply/restore semantics, including the interaction
       with the Cheri Block eval-time weight cache.
   * - ``tests/test_losses.py``
     - ``_mixture_loss`` shapes and edge cases.
   * - ``tests/test_performance.py``
     - Evaluation-metric correctness, including the grouped and
       ``within_peak_`` variants.
   * - ``tests/test_wrappers.py``
     - The output wrappers on their own and composed over
       ``ControlWrapper``.
   * - ``tests/test_config.py``
     - The config schemas: required keys, ``null`` for a key the
       pipeline produces, typo and type rejection, and how the
       pipeline's step sections link to its top-level keys.
   * - ``tests/test_utils.py``
     - ``resolve_inputs``: relative paths made absolute, every missing
       path listed, remote paths skipped.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_main.py``
     - The dispatcher: ``-p`` plus overrides, errors for typos and
       missing keys, ``--cfg job`` templates, multirun job
       directories, and ``install-skill``.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_fit.py``
     - The fit step's wiring: the settings, accelerator and schedule
       lengths it passes to :func:`cherimoya.training.fit`, seed
       handling across ranks, parameter routing to the three
       optimizers, and the fit defaults.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_pipeline.py``
     - Which keys a pipeline config may leave out, and a drawn seed
       reaching every step.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_pipeline_dry_run.py``
     - ``dry_run`` writing the per-step YAML files and nothing else.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_step_skipping.py``
     - ``skip`` and the marginalization guard returning rather than
       ending the interpreter.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_config_keys.py``
     - Every pipeline step section is typed by that subcommand's
       schema, and every schema key is read, apart from a pinned list
       of known exceptions.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_compile_knob.py``
     - The ``compile`` keys reaching ``Cherimoya.load`` from each
       subcommand that loads a model.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_attribute_to_seqlets.py``
     - The seam between the two: the coordinate ``seqlets`` reports
       is the genome position of the base ``attribute`` scored.
   * - ``tests/commands/test_attribute.py``,
       ``test_seqlets.py``, ``test_evaluate.py``,
       ``test_marginalize.py``, ``test_negatives.py``,
       ``test_install_skill.py``
     - The remaining subcommands, one file each.

Fixtures shared across the CLI tests, a pipeline config naming real
input files and a runner for it, live in
``tests/commands/conftest.py``. ``make_config`` in ``tests/conftest.py``
composes any subcommand's config with overrides.

Markers:

* ``@pytest.mark.cuda`` — requires a CUDA device; skipped on
  CPU-only hosts.
* ``@pytest.mark.triton`` — requires both a CUDA device and a
  Triton install.

Both markers are wired through ``tests/conftest.py``, which also
disables ``torch.compile`` for the suite so tests don't pay the
several-minute autotune cost on every run.

To run only the CPU-safe subset:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest tests/ -m "not cuda and not triton"

To run only the GPU parity tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest tests/ -m "cuda or triton"


What continuous integration does and does not cover
---------------------------------------------------

Three jobs run on every pull request and every push to ``main``:

* ``pytest`` — the CPU suite on Python 3.10 through 3.13.
* ``docs`` — the Sphinx build with ``-W``, so a broken ``:doc:`` or
  ``:ref:`` link fails the build. ``conf.py`` mocks every heavy
  import, so this job does not check that the package imports; the
  ``pytest`` job does.
* ``lint`` — ``ruff`` restricted to syntax errors, undefined names and
  broken comparisons. The full default rule set reports findings on
  this tree that are worth fixing but are a separate change from
  adding the gate.

**No hosted runner has a GPU, so nothing in CI exercises the CUDA or
Triton paths.** That includes the three-way forward parity between the
CPU fallback, the training Triton kernel and the inference megakernel,
which is the invariant most worth protecting. Before merging anything
that touches a kernel, a ``state_dict``, module structure or the
count/profile heads, run both of these on a machine with a GPU:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest tests/ -m "cuda or triton"
   python compat/run.py --a origin/main --b HEAD --preset full

``compat/`` is gitignored local tooling; see its README first.


Benchmarking
------------

The forward-path timings in :doc:`benchmarks` come from
``bench_kernels.py``, a local development script that is not tracked
in git or shipped with the package. That page gives the measurement
methodology and the agreement between the three paths.


Coding conventions
------------------

* **Tabs, not spaces.** The codebase uses tab indentation throughout.
* **Channels-last layout** ``(N, L, C)`` is used inside the Cheri
  Block backbone. The input stem and output heads do the necessary
  transpositions. New blocks should follow the same convention.
* **fp32 for normalization statistics** even under bf16 autocast.
  Both the CPU fallback and the Triton kernels accumulate ``sum`` /
  ``sq_sum`` in fp32; this is load-bearing for stability and
  shouldn't be changed casually.
* **Triton autotune keys.** The training kernels are keyed by
  ``(C, L)`` so the same configuration is reused across batches with
  the same shapes; the inference kernels add ``N`` and ``WRITE_Y``
  (stats) or ``M``, ``H`` and ``RECOMPUTE_CONV`` (norm and MLP).
  Adding a new kernel that depends on a new shape parameter should
  add that parameter to the key.
* **No public bias terms inside Cheri Blocks.** The input stem,
  profile head, and count head use biases; the block layers do not.
  This is intentional (see :doc:`architecture`).
