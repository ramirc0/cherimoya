**A compact deep learning model for predicting genomic profile data from DNA
sequence.**

Cherimoya predicts genomic modalities — transcription factor binding,
chromatin accessibility, and transcription initiation — directly from DNA
sequence. It pairs a lightweight ConvNeXt-style backbone with custom Triton
GPU kernels for both training and inference, and ships with an end-to-end
CLI that takes BAM files through peak calling, training, attribution, and
motif discovery in a single command.

.. admonition:: Under Active Development

   Cherimoya is still evolving and may introduce breaking changes between
   versions. Pin the version you train with if you need to reload
   checkpoints later.


Where to start
--------------

* **Bioinformaticians** running Cherimoya on their data: read
  :doc:`installation`, then :doc:`tutorials/cli_pipeline` for an
  end-to-end walkthrough, then pick the recipe that matches your assay
  in :doc:`recipes/chipseq_tf`, :doc:`recipes/atacseq`, or
  :doc:`recipes/dnaseq`. Comparing across conditions?
  :doc:`recipes/differential`.
* **Researchers** using Cherimoya from Python: read
  :doc:`installation`, then :doc:`tutorials/python_api`, then explore
  :doc:`tutorials/attribution`, :doc:`tutorials/variant_effect`, and
  :doc:`tutorials/save_load`. For models that predict more than one
  modality from a shared backbone — stranded ChIP-seq, or
  co-training ATAC alongside several TFs — see :doc:`multi_task`.
* **Developers** integrating Cherimoya or contributing to it: read
  :doc:`development` for repo layout and the test suite, then
  :doc:`architecture` and the :doc:`api/model` / :doc:`api/cheri`
  reference pages.

If a term is unfamiliar, :doc:`glossary` defines everything used in
the rest of these docs. If something is going wrong, start with
:doc:`troubleshooting`.


Design highlights
-----------------

* **Cheri Blocks**. A dilated depthwise convolution fused with a
  per-example layer normalization and a channel-mixing MLP, implemented
  as a custom Triton kernel. The default 9-layer model is ~600K
  parameters with a 1115 bp receptive field.
* **Three forward paths, one set of weights**. A CPU fallback, a
  Triton fwd+bwd kernel for training, and a fwd-only megakernel for
  inference, all numerically equivalent up to ~1e-5 max-abs.
* **Three-optimizer training**. Muon for 2D projection weights, SGD
  for the Kendall uncertainty weights, AdamW for everything else,
  with hyperparameters tuned via large-scale sweeps.
* **Learned loss balancing**. Kendall-Gal uncertainty weighting with
  one learnable weight per output track replaces a fixed
  profile/counts loss weight.
* **EMA at evaluation**. An exponential moving average of the
  parameters is maintained during training and used at evaluation,
  smoothing both the validation curve and the final predictions.
* **Stability-first defaults**. Small fixed residual scale at
  initialization, no biases inside Cheri Blocks, no weight decay on
  Muon-routed weights, and a 2-epoch warmup before cosine decay.

See :doc:`architecture` for the full story and :doc:`benchmarks` for
measured numbers.
