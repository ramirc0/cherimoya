Glossary
========

A quick reference for terms that appear throughout the documentation.
Definitions are scoped to how the word is used inside Cherimoya, not
to the broader literature.


Sequence-to-function (S2F) model
   A neural network that takes a DNA sequence as input and predicts a
   biological readout (e.g. read coverage from a sequencing assay) at
   each base or over the whole sequence. Cherimoya is an S2F model.

One-hot encoded DNA
   A DNA sequence of length ``L`` represented as a ``(4, L)`` tensor
   where row 0 is the indicator for A, row 1 for C, row 2 for G, row 3
   for T, and any ``N`` base is all zeros. ``tangermeme.utils.one_hot_encode``
   produces this from a Python string; ``tangermeme.io.extract_loci``
   produces this from a FASTA file plus a BED of loci.

Profile and counts
   Cherimoya predicts two things per input: a **profile** (per-base
   logits over the output window — what the read coverage looks like
   *shape*-wise) and a **counts** scalar or per-track count (the log
   of the total number of reads expected in the window). The profile
   is normalized into a probability distribution via softmax for the
   MNLL loss; the counts are predicted in log space.

Signal group
   A set of output channels that share an orientation and are treated
   as one biological modality. An unstranded track (e.g. ATAC, DNase)
   is a single-channel group; a stranded BPNet-style ``(+, -)`` pair
   is a two-channel group. Each group emits one count prediction (so
   the two strands of a pair share a single per-locus count) and its
   channels swap among themselves under reverse-complement
   augmentation while groups stay independent of one another. The
   model's ``signal_groups=[1]`` default is a single unstranded
   track; ``[2]`` is a stranded pair; ``[1, 2]`` is an unstranded
   track co-trained with a stranded pair.

Input window vs output window vs trimming
   The model receives a longer sequence (``in_window``, default 2114
   bp) than it predicts over (``out_window``, default 1000 bp). The
   difference, half on each side, is the **trimming** — the
   context the model uses to predict the central window. The default
   trimming of 557 bp matches the model's receptive field.

Receptive field
   The number of input bases that can influence a single output
   prediction. For Cherimoya's default 9-layer backbone it is 1115 bp.
   The 21-bp input stem plus the dilated stack
   (dilations ``1, 2, 4, …, 256``) gives this number.

Saturation mutagenesis (in silico)
   The exhaustive *in-silico* variant scan: for each position in a
   region, evaluate the model on all four single-nucleotide
   substitutions and record the predicted delta. Each base position
   gets a 4-dim vector of "hypothetical importance scores", and
   multiplying by the actual one-hot sequence yields the importance
   of the base that *is* there. Cherimoya's ``attribute`` subcommand
   wraps ``tangermeme.saturation_mutagenesis.saturation_mutagenesis``.

Hypothetical vs actual importance
   *Hypothetical* importance is the score every possible base would
   have at each position (shape ``(4, L)`` per example). *Actual*
   importance is the score the base that is actually there has,
   computed by elementwise multiplying the hypothetical scores with
   the one-hot encoding and summing across the base axis (shape
   ``(L,)`` per example). Both are useful for different downstream
   analyses.

Seqlet
   A contiguous subsequence with high attribution scores. Cherimoya
   uses ``tangermeme.seqlet.recursive_seqlets`` to extract seqlets
   from the actual-importance signal; the resulting BED file is the
   input to TF-MoDISco.

TF-MoDISco
   *Transcription Factor MOtif Discovery from Importance SCOres.* An
   algorithm that clusters seqlets across a dataset to discover
   recurring motif patterns. Cherimoya's pipeline calls TF-MoDISco
   as a downstream step and produces both an HDF5 of patterns and an
   HTML report.

tomtom-lite (``ttl``)
   A fast motif-similarity tool used to label discovered seqlets
   against a known motif database in MEME format (typically JASPAR).
   Distinct from full TomTom; the ``-lite`` variant uses precomputed
   score binning to score thousands of seqlets quickly.

Marginalization
   A causal evaluation of motif effects: insert a known motif from a
   MEME database into the center of negative (non-peak) sequences and
   measure the predicted change in profile and counts. Produces one
   measurement per (motif, locus) pair.

MEME format
   The plain-text motif database format used by the MEME suite. A
   motif is encoded as a position probability matrix. JASPAR releases
   their database in this format.

GC-matched negatives
   Non-peak control regions selected to have the same GC-content
   distribution as the peaks. Cherimoya uses these as negative
   training examples; ``tangermeme.match.extract_matching_loci``
   does the matching. Without GC-matching, the model can learn to
   predict "peak vs background" via GC alone, which is uninformative.

Muon optimizer
   A second-order-flavored optimizer that orthogonalizes its update
   matrix before applying it. Cherimoya uses Muon for the 2D
   projection weights inside Cheri Blocks (the ``linear1`` and
   ``linear2`` weights) and AdamW for everything else.

Kendall-Gal uncertainty weighting
   A technique for combining multi-task losses without a fixed
   hyperparameter: each task gets a learnable scalar that scales its
   loss, with a log-squared regularizer that prevents the scalar from
   going to zero. Cherimoya uses two such scalars (``lw0`` for
   profile loss, ``lw1`` for counts loss) and freezes them once their
   gradients become negligible.

EMA (exponential moving average)
   A shadow copy of every model parameter that is updated as
   ``shadow = decay * shadow + (1 - decay) * parameter`` after each
   optimizer step. Cherimoya uses decay 0.999 by default. The shadow
   weights produce smoother validation curves and are what gets
   saved to the ``.torch`` checkpoint.

Tn5 transposase / +4 / −4 shift
   ATAC-seq uses the Tn5 transposase, which cuts and inserts adapters
   at preferred positions. The cut site lies 4 bp into each end of
   the resulting fragment. Pipelines correct for this by shifting +
   strand alignments by +4 bp and − strand alignments by −5 bp (or
   −4, used by Cherimoya for symmetry). The correction reflects where
   Tn5 *cut*, which is the biologically meaningful event, rather than
   where the read aligns.

bam2bw
   The streaming BAM/SAM/fragment-file → bigWig converter used by
   the Cherimoya pipeline. It reads the input file (local or remote),
   counts reads (or fragments, with optional shifts) into per-base
   coverage bins, and emits one or two bigWig files (stranded or
   unstranded). Cherimoya invokes it automatically when a pipeline
   step receives BAM/SAM/fragment input; it can also be used
   standalone.
