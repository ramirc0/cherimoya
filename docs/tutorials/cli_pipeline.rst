CLI Pipeline Walkthrough
========================

This page is the user's guide to the end-to-end Cherimoya CLI: how to
take raw BAM/BED files and a reference genome through peak calling,
training, attribution, seqlet calling, motif discovery, and motif
marginalization in a single reproducible run.

For a complete list of every CLI flag, every JSON key, and every
default value, see :doc:`../cli`. For assay-specific recipes
(TF ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNase-seq) see the recipe pages.


Prerequisites
-------------

You will need:

- Cherimoya installed (see :doc:`../installation`).
- A reference genome FASTA file (e.g. ``hg38.fa``).
- One or more signal files (BAM/SAM, fragment BED/TSV, or bigWig).
- A motif database in MEME format (optional, used by TF-MoDISco
  reports and marginalization).
- Optional: a BED of peak coordinates. If you don't provide one, the
  pipeline calls peaks with MACS3.
- Optional: BED of GC-matched negative regions. If you don't provide
  one, the pipeline samples them automatically.

All file inputs can be remote URLs (``http://``, ``https://``,
``s3://``, ``gs://``). ``bam2bw`` streams the data directly without
downloading the file first; the validation step before the run only
checks paths that look local.


Subcommands at a glance
-----------------------

The two commands you actually run, in the order you run them:

* ``cherimoya pipeline-json`` — emit a fully-populated JSON config
  from a handful of CLI pointers.
* ``cherimoya pipeline`` — run the full end-to-end pipeline from
  that JSON.

Every other subcommand (``fit``, ``evaluate``, ``attribute``,
``seqlets``, ``marginalize``, ``negatives``, ``batch``) corresponds
to an individual pipeline stage and can be run on its own. Each is
driven by its own JSON, which the pipeline writes alongside its
outputs. See :doc:`../cli` for the full subcommand reference.


Two-step workflow
-----------------

The expected workflow is two steps: generate a JSON, then run it.

Step 1: generate a pipeline JSON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For stranded ChIP-seq with input controls:

.. code-block:: bash

   cherimoya pipeline-json \
       -s hg38.fa -p peaks.narrowPeak \
       -i input1.bam -i input2.bam \
       -c control1.bam -c control2.bam \
       -m JASPAR_2024.meme -n my_experiment -o pipeline.json

For unstranded paired-end ATAC-seq with the standard +4 / -4 fragment
shift:

.. code-block:: bash

   cherimoya pipeline-json \
       -s hg38.fa -p peaks.narrowPeak \
       -i fragments.bam -m JASPAR_2024.meme \
       -n atac_experiment -o pipeline.json \
       -ps 4 -ns -4 -u -f -pe

Repeating ``-i`` adds another signal file. Repeating ``-c`` adds
another control. Repeating ``-p`` adds another peak file. The full
``pipeline-json`` flag list is in :doc:`../cli`.

The resulting JSON has every parameter the pipeline uses, filled in
from ``cherimoya_cli.defaults.default_pipeline_parameters``. You only
need to edit the values you want to change from defaults; the runtime
re-merges with defaults before each step.

Step 2: edit and run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the JSON and override any defaults — model width, training and
validation chromosomes, seqlet p-value threshold, MoDISco settings,
anything in the JSON.

.. code-block:: bash

   cherimoya pipeline -p pipeline.json

What this does, in order:

1. **MACS3 peak calling** (skipped if ``loci`` is set).
2. **bam2bw conversion** to bigWig (skipped if signals are already
   bigWigs).
3. **GC-matched negative sampling** (skipped if ``negatives`` is set).
4. **Model training** — writes ``{name}.torch`` (best checkpoint by
   validation count Pearson) and ``{name}.final.torch`` (EMA weights
   at end of training), plus ``{name}.log``.
5. **Attribution** via saturation mutagenesis over the central 400 bp
   of each example, saved as ``{name}.attributions.{ohe,attr}.npz``
   and ``{name}.attributions.idxs.npy``.
6. **Seqlet identification** with TF-MoDISco-style recursive seqlet
   calling on the (attribution × one-hot) signal, written to
   ``{name}.seqlets.bed``.
7. **tomtom-lite seqlet annotation** against the motif database, if
   ``motifs`` was provided; results in
   ``{name}.seqlets_annotated.bed`` and a counts table in
   ``{name}.motif_seqlet_count.tsv``.
8. **TF-MoDISco motif discovery** and HTML report; results in
   ``{name}_modisco_results.h5`` and ``{name}_modisco/``.
9. **Marginalization** — measures the predicted effect of inserting
   each motif into negative backgrounds. Output in
   ``{name}_marginalize/``.

Each sub-step writes its own JSON snapshot
(``{name}.fit.json``, ``{name}.attribute.json``, …) so individual
stages can be re-run in isolation, and pre-existing snapshots can be
edited and re-run if you only need to change one stage.


Running individual steps
------------------------

Each stage has its own subcommand and JSON schema. You can run them
directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   cherimoya fit -p my_experiment.fit.json
   cherimoya evaluate -p my_experiment.evaluate.json
   cherimoya attribute -p my_experiment.attribute.json
   cherimoya seqlets -p my_experiment.seqlets.json
   cherimoya marginalize -p my_experiment.marginalize.json

The defaults for each command are in
``cherimoya_cli.defaults.default_*_parameters``; the merged JSON
snapshots written by ``pipeline`` make them concrete.

Every step JSON also supports ``"skip": true`` to no-op that step.


Batch mode
----------

For training the same configuration across many datasets in parallel
on multiple GPUs:

.. code-block:: bash

   cherimoya batch -p batch.json

Minimal ``batch.json``:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "name": null,
       "device": "*",
       "signals": "/path/to/data/*.bam",
       "sequences": "/path/to/hg38.fa"
   }

Behavior:

* ``"device": "*"`` is expanded to the full list of available CUDA
  devices (``cuda:0``, ``cuda:1``, …).
* When ``"signals"`` is a glob and ``"name"`` is ``null``, names are
  derived from the signal filenames automatically.
* Each derived job is written to its own ``{name}.pipeline.json`` and
  run via ``cherimoya pipeline``. Joblib distributes jobs round-robin
  across the device list.

To use batch mode with custom names or paired-up controls/loci/negatives,
provide same-length lists in those fields; element ``i`` is consumed by
job ``i``.


About bam2bw
------------

The pipeline does not call BAM/SAM/fragment files directly into the
training step — it converts them to bigWig first using the
``bam2bw`` tool, which is a hard dependency. ``bam2bw`` streams the
input (local or remote URL), counts reads or fragments into per-base
coverage, optionally applies a ± shift (used for Tn5 / DNase
corrections), and emits one bigWig (unstranded) or two bigWigs
(``+`` / ``-`` stranded).

This conversion is what enables remote URLs as inputs: ``bam2bw``
fetches reads via byte-range requests rather than downloading the
whole file. The resulting bigWigs are written into the working
directory and re-used by every downstream stage.

If your signals are already bigWigs, the pipeline skips this step
automatically. To use ``bam2bw`` standalone (outside the pipeline),
invoke it directly — see its own documentation.


Calling negatives independently
-------------------------------

``cherimoya pipeline`` calls negatives for you when the JSON's
``negatives`` field is null. If you want to sample GC-matched
negatives without running the full pipeline (e.g. you're going to
train a non-Cherimoya model on the same regions), use the
``negatives`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: bash

   cherimoya negatives \
       -i peaks.narrowPeak \
       -f hg38.fa \
       -b signal.bw \
       -o negatives.bed \
       --bin_width 0.02 --max_n_perc 0.1 --beta 0.5

The output is a 3-column BED of regions matched by GC content to the
input peaks, with at most ``--max_n_perc`` fraction of ``N`` bases
and (optionally) signal below ``--beta × min(peak_counts)``.


Running on a non-hg38 reference
-------------------------------

The defaults assume hg38. To run on a different reference (mouse mm10,
non-human, or a different hg version), override three keys in the
pipeline JSON:

* ``fit_parameters.training_chroms`` — chromosomes used to train.
  Replace with the appropriate list for your reference (e.g. mm10:
  ``["chr1", "chr2", …, "chr19", "chrX", "chrY"]`` minus the two
  validation chromosomes you choose).
* ``fit_parameters.validation_chroms`` — held-out chromosomes for
  validation. Two chromosomes is enough.
* ``preprocessing_parameters.callpeaks_gsize`` — MACS3 effective
  genome size. Use ``"mm"`` for mouse, ``"ce"`` for *C. elegans*,
  ``"dm"`` for fly, or a numeric value (e.g. ``"2.7e9"`` for hg38) for
  any other organism.

For non-chromosome reference contigs (scaffolds, alternate
haplotypes, viral integrations), exclude them by listing them
explicitly in the training/validation chromosome lists, or by passing
an ``exclusion_lists`` BED.
