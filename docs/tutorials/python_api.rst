Python API Tutorial
===================

This tutorial shows how to use the Cherimoya Python API to build a
model, train it, and generate predictions. For attribution, motif
analysis, and variant effect prediction see the dedicated tutorials.


Creating a model
----------------

``Cherimoya`` is a ``torch.nn.Module``:

.. code-block:: python

   from cherimoya import Cherimoya

   model = Cherimoya(
       n_filters=128,             # backbone width
       n_layers=9,                # number of Cheri Blocks (dilations 1, 2, ..., 256)
       signal_groups=[2],         # one stranded (+, -) group; see below
       n_control_tracks=0,        # number of control input tracks
       expansion=2,               # MLP expansion factor inside each Cheri Block
       residual_scale=0.15,       # fixed residual scale
       name="my_model",           # used for save filenames
       random_state=0,            # seeds the weight initialization
   ).cuda()

``signal_groups`` is the list of channel counts per signal group, one
group per biological modality. Examples:

* ``[1]`` — single unstranded track (e.g. ATAC). Default.
* ``[2]`` — one stranded ``(+, -)`` pair (e.g. BPNet-style ChIP).
  Two profile channels but one shared count prediction; the two
  strands swap places under reverse-complement augmentation.
* ``[1, 2]`` — co-train an unstranded ATAC head with a stranded TF
  head. Three profile channels, two count predictions. Groups are
  independent under RC: only the inner ``(+, -)`` channels swap, the
  ATAC channel stays put.

The full constructor signature, including ``trimming`` and
``verbose``, is in :doc:`../api/model`.


Input/output shapes
-------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 35 40

   * - Tensor
     - Shape
     - Description
   * - ``X`` (input)
     - ``(N, 4, in_window)``
     - One-hot encoded DNA over the input window. ``in_window`` is
       2114 by default.
   * - ``X_ctl`` (optional)
     - ``(N, n_control_tracks, in_window)``
     - Per-position control signal. Pass ``None`` when ``n_control_tracks
       == 0``.
   * - ``y_profile`` (output)
     - ``(N, sum(signal_groups), out_window)``
     - Predicted profile logits — one channel per signal channel.
       ``out_window`` is 1000 by default.
   * - ``y_counts`` (output)
     - ``(N, len(signal_groups))``
     - Predicted log counts — one per signal *group*. A stranded
       ``(+, -)`` group shares a single per-group count.

By default ``trimming = 46 + sum(2**i for i in range(n_layers))``,
which is 557 for the default 9-layer model and gives the 2114 → 1000
window pair.


Loading training data
---------------------

:func:`cherimoya.io.PeakGenerator` reads peaks, negatives, sequences,
and signal/control bigWigs, applies filtering and jitter, and returns
a ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``. Training takes the dataset inside
it, a :class:`cherimoya.io.PeakNegativeSampler`, and builds its own
loader around it:

.. code-block:: python

   from cherimoya.io import PeakGenerator

   training_data = PeakGenerator(
       peaks="peaks.narrowPeak",
       negatives="negatives.bed",
       sequences="hg38.fa",
       signals=[["signal.+.bw", "signal.-.bw"]],   # one stranded group
       controls=None,                              # or list of bigWigs
       chroms=["chr2", "chr4", "chr5"],     # training chromosomes
       in_window=2114,
       out_window=1000,
       max_jitter=500,                      # peak-center jitter at training time
       negative_ratio=0.25,                 # n_negatives per n_peaks per epoch
       reverse_complement=True,             # augment with reverse complements
       random_state=0,                      # base seed; reproducible
       verbose=True,                        # print progress and filter counts
   ).dataset

Setting ``verbose=True`` prints per-step counts of filtered peaks and
filtered negatives, which is the easiest way to verify the loader is
seeing the data you expect.


Reproducible sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The underlying :class:`cherimoya.io.PeakNegativeSampler` is fully
deterministic given ``random_state``. ``__getitem__(idx)`` is a pure
function of ``idx`` and the current epoch, with no dependence on call
history.

* Each epoch yields exactly ``n_peaks + int(n_peaks * negative_ratio)``
  examples; every peak appears exactly once and the peak/negative
  interleaving is reproducible.
* Setting ``num_workers > 1`` produces the *same* sequence of batches
  as ``num_workers = 1``, just faster.
* Per-position jitter and reverse-complement flips are drawn from the
  per-epoch RNG, so two runs with the same seed produce bit-identical
  training data.

The sampler is only half of a reproducible run. Pass ``random_state``
to ``Cherimoya`` as well to fix the weight initialization, which is
what ``cherimoya fit`` does with the single seed in its config.


Preparing validation data
-------------------------

Validation data is loaded as a single block of tensors using
``tangermeme.io.extract_loci``:

.. code-block:: python

   from tangermeme.io import extract_loci

   valid_data = extract_loci(
       sequences="hg38.fa",
       signals=["signal.+.bw", "signal.-.bw"],
       loci="peaks.narrowPeak",
       chroms=["chr8", "chr20"],
       in_window=2114,
       out_window=1000,
       max_jitter=0,
       ignore=list('QWERYUIOPSDFHJKLZXVBNM'),
   )

   X_valid, y_valid = valid_data
   # X_valid, y_valid, X_ctl_valid = valid_data   # with controls

The validation measures are computed on these peaks. To also measure
how well the predicted counts separate peaks from negatives, append
the negatives on the same chromosomes and label each row:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch

   X_neg, y_neg = extract_loci(
       sequences="hg38.fa",
       signals=["signal.+.bw", "signal.-.bw"],
       loci="negatives.bed",
       chroms=["chr8", "chr20"],
       in_window=2114,
       out_window=1000,
       max_jitter=0,
       ignore=list('QWERYUIOPSDFHJKLZXVBNM'),
   )

   labels_valid = torch.cat([torch.ones(len(X_valid)), torch.zeros(len(X_neg))])
   X_valid = torch.cat([X_valid, X_neg])
   y_valid = torch.cat([y_valid, y_neg])

Passing ``labels_valid`` to ``fit`` (below) keeps every existing
measure and the checkpoint choice on the peaks, and fills the four log
columns before ``Saved?``: the count Pearson and MSE over peaks and negatives
together, and the AUROC and AUPRC. With controls, append the
negatives' controls to ``X_ctl_valid`` the same way.


Training
--------

:func:`cherimoya.training.fit` builds a PyTorch Lightning ``Trainer``
around a :class:`cherimoya.training.CherimoyaModule` and returns the
trainer after fitting. The module builds the optimizers and learning
rate schedules itself, so only their hyperparameters are passed. The
module's schedule defaults are no warmup (``n_warmup_steps=0``) and a
decay over the rest of the run (``n_decay_steps=None``), which is not
the CLI's schedule; to match ``cherimoya fit``, count the steps per
epoch the way it does and pass both. ``cherimoya fit`` also
raises ``max_epochs`` until the run reaches ``min_total_steps`` steps
(20000 by default) before laying out the schedule; the snippet below
does not.


.. code-block:: python

   from cherimoya.training import fit

   batch_size = 64
   max_epochs = 20
   n_warmup_epochs = 2
   steps_per_epoch = -(-len(training_data) // batch_size)   # ceiling division

   trainer = fit(
       model,
       training_data,
       X_valid,
       y_valid,
       X_ctl_valid=None,            # pass control tensors here if using controls
       labels_valid=None,           # 1 per peak row, 0 per negative (see above)
       max_epochs=max_epochs,
       early_stopping=None,         # default: train all max_epochs; an int stops
                                    # after that many epochs without count-Pearson gain
       dtype='float32',             # or 'bfloat16' / 'float16' for mixed precision
       accelerator='gpu',
       devices=1,                   # more than one trains with DDP
       batch_size=batch_size,       # global batch, split evenly across devices
       num_workers=1,               # data-loading workers per device
       verbose=True,                # print the per-epoch table
       n_warmup_steps=steps_per_epoch * n_warmup_epochs,
       n_decay_steps=steps_per_epoch * max(1, max_epochs - n_warmup_epochs),
   )

The remaining keyword arguments, ``labels_valid`` among them, are
passed to :class:`~cherimoya.training.CherimoyaModule`: the learning
rates and
weight decays (``muon_lr``, ``muon_wd``, ``adam_lr``, ``adam_wd``,
``lw_lr``, ``lw_wd``, ``lw_momentum``), ``loss_weights`` and
``ema_decay``. The learning rate, weight decay, momentum and
``loss_weights`` defaults match the CLI defaults.

Cherimoya uses a three-optimizer strategy: Muon for the 2D projection
weights in the Cheri Blocks, AdamW for the head/tail layers, biases,
and the per-block ``conv_weight``, and SGD for the Kendall uncertainty
weights ``lw0`` / ``lw1``. The Muon and AdamW rates warm up linearly
from 1% over ``n_warmup_steps`` and then follow a cosine decay to
``1e-5`` over ``n_decay_steps``; the ``lw`` rate warms up and is then
held constant.

What ``fit`` does internally:

* Maintains an :class:`~cherimoya.cherimoya.EMA` shadow of every
  floating-point parameter (decay 0.999 by default). The shadow is
  updated after every optimizer step.
* Runs the training step under Lightning's precision setting for
  ``dtype``: ``'32-true'`` for ``'float32'``, ``'bf16-mixed'`` for
  ``'bfloat16'`` and ``'16-mixed'`` for ``'float16'``, which also
  scales the loss.
* Validates at the end of each epoch using the EMA-applied weights;
  the validation Pearson correlation on counts is the metric used for
  best-checkpoint selection.
* Saves ``{model.name}.torch`` whenever validation count Pearson
  improves, and ``{model.name}.final.torch`` at the very end (also
  with EMA weights applied).
* Saves ``{model.name}.log`` with the training and validation metrics
  per epoch, and ``{model.name}.detailed.log`` with a profile Pearson,
  count Pearson, AUROC and AUPRC column per signal group added.
* Computes the validation measures on peaks. Pass ``labels_valid``,
  1 for each peak row of ``X_valid`` and 0 for each negative, to add
  the count Pearson and MSE over peaks and negatives together and the
  AUROC and AUPRC of the predicted log counts at telling them apart.
  Without it, those columns are empty.
* With ``verbose=True``, prints the same table as it is written, one
  row per epoch. ``progress_bar`` controls Lightning's progress bar:
  ``None`` (the default) draws it only when stdout is a terminal or a
  Jupyter kernel, and ``True`` or ``False`` force it on or off. Rows
  are printed above the bar, and the latest validation profile and
  count Pearson are shown to its right.

After ``fit`` returns, ``model`` holds the EMA weights. Lightning
moves the model to the CPU when fitting ends, so move it back with
``model.cuda()`` before running inference on a GPU, or load the saved
checkpoint with :meth:`~cherimoya.Cherimoya.load`. The returned
trainer holds the run's results:

.. code-block:: python

   trainer.checkpoint_callback.best_model_score   # best validation count Pearson
   trainer.current_epoch                          # epochs trained
   trainer.callback_metrics                       # the last epoch's values of
                                                  # train_profile_mnll,
                                                  # train_count_mse,
                                                  # valid_profile_pearson,
                                                  # valid_count_pearson,
                                                  # valid_count_pearson_all,
                                                  # valid_count_mse_all,
                                                  # valid_auroc and
                                                  # valid_auprc

``fit`` raises a ``ValueError`` when the training set has fewer
examples than one ``batch_size``, since no training step could be
taken.

Once the gradients on ``lw0`` (the profile loss-weight scalar) become
small at the end of an epoch, both loss-weight scalars are frozen and
the loss reduces to a fixed weighted sum for the rest of training.


Training on several GPUs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``devices`` greater than one (or ``-1`` for every visible
device), ``fit`` trains with DDP. ``batch_size`` is the global batch
and must be divisible by the number of devices; each device takes an
equal contiguous slice of every global batch through
:class:`cherimoya.io.ShardedEpochSampler`, so each step sees exactly
the examples a single device would. Validation is split across the
devices without padding, and the metrics are computed over the whole
validation set.

Lightning starts every rank after the first by re-running the current
command, so a script that calls ``fit`` runs once per rank from the
top. Three things follow:

* **Run it as a script.** Lightning refuses the ``ddp`` strategy in a
  Jupyter notebook, so ``fit`` with more than one device raises there.
* **Seed the data.** Pass an integer ``random_state`` to
  :func:`~cherimoya.io.PeakGenerator`, so that every rank draws the
  same examples for each epoch and the slices fit together. DDP copies
  rank 0's initial weights to the other ranks, but it does not align
  the data.
* **Write from one rank.** Every rank gets a trainer back from
  ``fit``. The checkpoints and logs are already written by rank 0 only;
  guard anything the script does afterwards the same way:

.. code-block:: python

   trainer = fit(model, training_data, X_valid, y_valid,
       accelerator='gpu', devices=4, batch_size=256)   # plus the schedule above

   if trainer.is_global_zero:
       best = Cherimoya.load(model.name + ".torch", device="cuda")
       # evaluate, plot and write files here

Choose the GPUs with ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``: ``devices=4`` trains on
the first four visible GPUs. Each rank holds its own copy of the
training and validation data in host memory and runs its own
``num_workers`` loader workers. :ref:`Training on several devices
<cli-several-devices>` in the CLI reference covers SLURM.


Saving and loading
------------------

See :doc:`save_load` for the full discussion. Briefly:

.. code-block:: python

   model.save("my_model.torch")
   model = Cherimoya.load("my_model.torch", device="cuda")


Making predictions
------------------

For evaluation use the standard ``tangermeme.predict`` helper, which
batches the input and concatenates the outputs:

.. code-block:: python

   from tangermeme.predict import predict

   model.eval()
   y_profile, y_counts = predict(
       model, X_test,
       batch_size=64,
       device='cuda',
       dtype='float32',
   )

Reverse-complement averaging often improves performance and is what
the ``evaluate`` CLI uses when ``reverse_complement_average`` is set:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch

   y_profile_rc, y_counts_rc = predict(
       model, torch.flip(X_test, dims=(-1, -2)),
       batch_size=64, device='cuda',
   )
   y_profile_avg = (y_profile + torch.flip(y_profile_rc, dims=(-1, -2))) / 2
   y_counts_avg = (y_counts + y_counts_rc) / 2


Evaluating performance
----------------------

:func:`cherimoya.performance.calculate_performance_measures` computes
profile and counts metrics. It takes predicted logits, observed
counts, and predicted log counts, and returns a dict of tensors:

.. code-block:: python

   from cherimoya.performance import calculate_performance_measures

   measures = calculate_performance_measures(
       y_profile, y_valid, y_counts,
       measures=['profile_pearson', 'count_pearson', 'profile_jsd'],
   )

   for name, values in measures.items():
       print(f"{name}: {values.mean().item():.4f}")

If ``measures`` is ``None`` (the default), all built-in measures are
computed. The full list and signature is in :doc:`../api/performance`.
For multi-group models (see :doc:`../multi_task`), pass
``signal_groups=model.signal_groups`` so the count metrics are
computed per group rather than against a single total target.


Interpreting the metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rough ballparks from typical ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments,
useful for sanity-checking a trained model:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 35 35

   * - Metric
     - Usable
     - Strong
   * - ``count_pearson``
     - ≥ 0.5
     - ≥ 0.7
   * - ``profile_pearson``
     - ≥ 0.3
     - ≥ 0.5
   * - ``profile_jsd``
     - ≤ 0.5
     - ≤ 0.3
   * - ``profile_mnll``
     - context-dependent — compare to baseline
     - context-dependent

Notes:

* Count Pearson is computed across the held-out set as a single
  scalar (one correlation across all examples), so it is sensitive
  to dynamic range. Datasets with a wider distribution of peak
  heights produce higher count Pearson at fixed model quality;
  comparing count Pearson across datasets is not apples-to-apples.
* Profile Pearson and JSD are per-example and then averaged, so
  they're more comparable across datasets but noisier per example.
* ``count_pearson`` near zero is almost always a sign of a setup
  problem (see :doc:`../troubleshooting`); a well-trained model on
  real data essentially never lands there.
* When training with controls, omitting ``controls`` at evaluation
  collapses ``count_pearson`` — the count head sees the wrong
  feature distribution.
* ``auroc`` and ``auprc`` in the training log and the evaluate TSV
  score the predicted log counts at separating peaks from negatives.
  AUPRC depends on the ratio of peaks to negatives, so compare it only
  between runs scored on the same negatives.
  ``calculate_performance_measures(..., labels=...)`` also returns
  ``auroc`` and ``auprc``, but for the first count output only, and
  with every other measure recomputed over peaks and negatives.
