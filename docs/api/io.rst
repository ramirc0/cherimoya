cherimoya.io
============

.. module:: cherimoya.io

Data loading utilities for training Cherimoya. The dataset is the
peak/negative mixture sampler; the function-style entry point
:func:`PeakGenerator` is the typical way to build a training
``DataLoader``.


PeakGenerator
-------------

.. autofunction:: PeakGenerator


PeakNegativeSampler
-------------------

.. autoclass:: PeakNegativeSampler
   :members:

   .. rubric:: Constructor

   .. automethod:: __init__

The sampler is fully deterministic given ``random_state`` and the
epoch number. ``__getitem__(idx)`` is a pure function of ``idx`` and
the current epoch, so ``num_workers > 1`` yields the same batch
sequence as ``num_workers = 1`` and two runs with the same seed
produce bit-identical training data.
